<em>The first couple deaths were merely something to strike fear in them. They trembled at the sight of bodies, of gore, of death. They never knew the people who were dead very well, and it was the same going their way. Nobody every knew Uriel. No... No they knew Uriel, they didn&#39;t know them. Them specifically. Each person that passed away like this was but a few drops in the dam. A couple little blips that didn&#39;t disturb the surface of the water for very long, and evaporated rather quickly whilst fluttering up to become clouds and the atmosphere.</em>

<em>And then Yuri died.</em>

<em>That was a typhoon. A millions gallons of water poured into the dam that caused a very large and apparent crack to snake up the outside of the dam. It caused the whole thing to tremble and lurch, but it didn&#39;t break quite yet.</em>

<em>And then Fumi died.</em>

<em>The dam ripped itself open. At the trial, Uriel begged her not to go. Not to die. It wasn&#39;t her time. She wasn&#39;t supposed to die just yet. But it was futile. The dark forest waited for nobody.</em>

<em>The dark forest hypothesis was a truly depressing hypothesis about the human world, Uriel never quite understood it. It went a little like this; anything living in space would view a level of sapience as a threat. Any civilization that reached out to extra terrestrials would blip out of existence as whatever dominant force there was would just flatten them to nothing for self preservation. But it was such a dumb idea, why, Earth sent out signals to space in the first place! Uriel actually came to Earth because of said radio signals. But their positivity broke with that dam. Perhaps... Uriel was the cause of the dark forest. They became friends with Yuri. Yuri learned too much. She... she died. Fumi too. Fumi learned too much, got too close. Did. Did Uriel kill them? Fumi? And Yuri? Was it their fault?</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1311804179651760169 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1311804179651760169><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, 28 November 2024 21:21">21:21</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

<em>Talking to herself like she was the only one here, she opens up and flips the switch on her lighter, the paltry flame dimly lighting the room before her. Carving her way through the darkness towards her destination in furtherance of her mediocre investigation, she immediately stops as she seems the familiar outline of a spacesuit, their ePad casting a soft blue light over the material in a distinctive way, with their helmet most likely reflecting his screen.

Khuong was the first time she had seen a dead body, but the joyful denial that played upon her face when that incident was over reared her defense mechanism’s ugly head. Gaeul’s graphic death and final words had broken her down to the point of a near-death experience, ripping away her innocence and forming a hurt in her soul that sometimes reflected even now, a hint of it even present in her in this decrepit hideout. And then Fumi… Caramel couldn’t help but think about her when looking at the one she was obviously the closest to right in front of her, giving the woman who rushed headlong into everything pause. A betrayal, a reminder of everything that she was lacking. A personal loss that she selfishly decided was entirely her fault.

But if there was anyone alive that was most like her in this twisted carnival, it would be Uriel. In an industry like hers, some v-tubers didn’t simply develop a brand to share to their audience, they created an entire persona to present to their world. For some it was just a means to an end, but for Caramel, it had become so intertwined with her sense of self that it folded into everything that she is and truly valued. Uriel was just like her in a way, perhaps adopting the image of an energetic space-person as a way to protect what was within the shell, the spacesuit more like armor to guard the vulnerable person inside from the world. Looking at the slumped figure in front of her, remembering that strong denial being shattered in front of her at the trial, only made her empathy grow stronger. Caramel wanted to respect what they valued, was it all a lie they perpetuated out of hurt? Or was a Martian who dated a mothman exactly how they wanted to be remembered, a fond story that brought her the strength hers did? Caramel’s voice rang out, trying to keep neutral.</em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, 29 November 2024 01:14">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1311862528426508348 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1311862528426508348><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, 29 November 2024 01:13">01:13</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Pluto always was my favorite planet… kinda hated that they <s>stole the election from it</s> stole that distinction from it.

Uriel couldn&#39;t tell. They could neither smell nor feel anything beyond what the helmet sheltered. It was a completely isolated tank that engulfed their head, more solitary than a space ship sailing the cosmos on its lonesome. The lovely wafting scent of candy was mute, it too lost to the empty blackness of Uriel&#39;s visor. Perhaps it was also thanks to the helmet that Uriel didn&#39;t exactly hear Caramel approaching. They kept pressing the call button, a maddening number of times. Over and over again. Nothing after nothing picked up their call.

<em>That empty blackness. A hollow ever expanding hungry color that swallowed up everything around it. It swallowed up the person under it until there was nothing left but Uriel. Caramel had her persona, it was her job, her livelihood. She kept the mask on here too, but for Uriel it was so much more intricate. Being a space cadet was more than dealing with stars and fictional space marvels and adventures. A space cadet was someone who was delusional, so wrapped up in a dream that they cast aside reality in hopes of sailing the stars. Uriel had said something like that to Fumi. Fumi... why wasn&#39;t she picking up? <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Briiiiiing</code>.</em>

<em>The blue light provided just enough brightness to drown out Caramel&#39;s lighter. It cast the shadow of the space cadet along the wall like they were an ancient cave painting that was etched in stone. The light swallowed up the darkness, clashing with their visor&#39;s black exterior. It was true! Caramel could see Uriel was calling Fumi. She could see that Uriel had done this dozens of times. Hundreds of times, maybe. Really, the number of times they&#39;d dialed her reached digits unknown to humanity. Uriel had been here, right here, since the trial. Kind of. They went back and forth between here and the trial tent many times, forever pacing and lost in the stars.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1311921636991303680 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1311921636991303680><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, 29 November 2024 05:08">05:08</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

Why did Fumi have to go ahead and unlock the keys to the spaceship, only to throw them away? It had only lead to the crash landing of Uriel’s entire personality, self-confidence, and self-reality, a massive hazard of a crater left on the Martian surface. It had been selfish indeed for her to speak to Fumi at the trial about her own feelings, when clearly Uriel and her had shared a far stronger bond. Before she even knew what she was doing, Caramel’s legs had started to move to get closer to the source of suffering and denial, the clicking of the cowboy boots against the floor rapidly approaching with a sense of urgency. She placed a knee on the bed, stopping herself from reaching out fully, like she expected someone in a state like this to lash out at any physical contact.

Was the uncharacteristically upset Martian a deviation from his normal cheerful self? Or was the Uriel she had grown envious of for their strength a fabrication, not a mere adopted costume like hers, but a now discarded disguise of suppression with nothing but a painted-on artificial smile?

<em>The Sixth Magnitude Star. The star with the faintest level of brightness that is still visible to the human eye. The light of the corrosive civilizations below the beautiful night sky reflects the pollution of mankind, the arrogance to stand against the universe by projecting the artificial glow of progress. If the concept of “Uriel”: the protective spacesuit, the cheerful attitude, and the lore behind it all, was this all-encompassing inky blackness that blotted out the sky, then the fledgling and suffering light within that had evolved into a shaky and terrified voice was the true person inside. Perhaps her own blinding light, and those of the others reflected back at The Sixth Magnitude Star were what paradoxically deepened the darkness of the entity to the point of invisibility. If they all fed into the protective measure of “Uriel” with collective enthusiasm, were they not in essence, denying the existence and validity of the dim brightness that struggled to reflect on to anything?

Caramel’s arms were crossed, and she backed away a little, troubled and not knowing what to say. If Uriel was truly real, she would have responded with so much hyperactive and enthused energy about the wonders of space. But this fiction was far too much for her now. At his mention of the object in her hand, she turned it away from them, as if protecting something tender and pure.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1312164028520464427 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1312164028520464427><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, 29 November 2024 21:11">21:11</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“O-Oh… it’s nothing really.

It was like an animatronic animal shedding its exterior fur, revealing the shiny plastic skin and dismantling the illusion forever. In order to progress, in order to get through, what route could she take? She was truly exhausted from the misery and sorrow like she was being weighed down by concrete shoes, not wishing to suppress anything anymore, to dampen a light to play along with games that a deceitful person wanted to engage in. Caramel felt the need to reflexively justify herself in response, the green tint of envy in her heart of them turning closer to the direction of pity.</em>

“You know, <em>Caramel Sweetney</em> is more than a name. It’s a brand, but it’s also an idea. If a name ever made me unhappy… I would throw it away, just like any bad idea. That shell may feel comfortable or even needed… but if you aren’t carrying on the dream for yourself or someone you care about, then it isn’t worth it. I love streaming for my people, genuinely, with my full force of sincere personality! I’m sure… in her last moments, even… Deja felt like I brought <em>some</em> value. Deja loved what was inside my heart, and what is <em>inside yours</em> too. W-Would she have wanted the space cadet or the real you when her armor was forcefully stripped away? She was comforted that you were upset… that you even wanted us to vote for you instead. Y-You owe it to her to try to be sincere! W-What if something happens, and y-you leave this planet without ever being truly happy?”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1312546396406288386 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1312546396406288386><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, 30 November 2024 22:30">22:30</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>She just sounded a little frustrated, injecting as much audible empathy as she could, but ignoring almost all of the space talk in favor of the truth.

There was no need for pretenses anymore, not for them, not when the next day wasn’t guaranteed for either of them. If she really wanted to understand them at a deeper level, to dive into the frightening dark void of denial and insanity, then she had to do something uncharacteristic of herself, so that she could shock their system back to some kind of recognizable reality.

<em>Caramel expertly maneuvered the touch screen, backing away from the bed a few steps like a dog protecting a new bone, non-aggressively territorial, and ready to be chased. She first went to the photos, traveling through the catacombs of memories like a grave keeper looking for a corpse long since forgotten, this time quite literally. Finding nothing promising, her eyes narrow at a particular private message. The young lady leaped onto the bed on all fours like an animal before readjusting herself, and displaying a few messages in particular from their DMs with Fumi. There was a look of determination that empowered her visage, and she almost sounded like an inexperienced attorney in training, scrolling through exhibits of evidence. She pointed the screen towards them, displaying what Fumi had said:</em> <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Fumi: “I don’t want this BS to be the only thing we have to tie us.”</code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1312546444905021492 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1312546444905021492><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, 30 November 2024 22:30">22:30</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“S-She was talking about something different at the time, but she wanted a bond beyond what you wanted to show the world too.

For every day I live… I’ll carry the people we’ve lost, try to do what they would have wanted. And clearly… you want to escape that prison of polyester and kevlar… don’t you? Deja wanted that for you!”

<em>Caramel flipped to the very last DM they had sent her, revealing the message. She just wanted them to see that looking up to the stars and wishing upon them only worked when you were your true authentic self. It was time for Uriel to start looking above at them like the rest of humanity, rather than down at them from the vast expanse of outer space.</em> <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Doddy: “next time we meet just call me Doddy”</code>

“And this is the proof, isn’t it? This name here, that is who you truly are inside, right? This message tells me one thing, that you had a moment of clarity and wanted her, after she was gone, to recognize who you were. I… wouldn’t be as selfish as a shellfish to use the name until you’re ready, b-but I can’t stand to see how clearly unhappy you are as Uriel. If it makes you sad, then I can forget about all the planets, about Mothman, about every single piece of lore you’ve dropped… if that doesn’t come from a place of light. D-Don’t disrespect me and give me more fake imagery that doesn’t mean anything…”

<em>Seeking truth in its highest form was a risky proposition. They were in an isolated area, it was very possible for this person to have a violent reaction to her forcefully banging on their defensive walls. Caramel’s mind was nowhere in that headspace, only seeing them as someone to be helped, than an actual threat. Only time would tell if she could actually made a difference.</em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, 30 November 2024 22:33">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She had always done everything she could to hold onto damaged goods that could one day be theoretically fixed, always having a tough time getting rid of anything. Did the repetitive chatter and fluctuating effectiveness of this Uriel persona make it worth throwing it away entirely?

It was the few moments of silence after a performance, the next seconds deciding where there would be a thunderous roar of applause, or an awkward silence of disapproval. Caramel recalled a familiar theater with wine red curtains that were cut evenly across the bottom to frame the wooden stage. Her hands pressed up against the bottom of their helmet, waiting anxiously to see the results. She had just put every effort into attempting to save yet another person. Please, don’t let her fail to reach another in need, fail in her primary value to the world. As the nervous words peddled out, Caramel looked up in surprise, like a doe who had just seen their mother do a kick flip over the car barreling towards them. Did that really just happen? All of her features relaxed as practice turned to perfection, unable to stop a satisfactory smile from appearing on her face, the grin of victory. It was almost like the salvation of others was her own.</em>

<em>She stopped herself at the torrent of outpouring pain and self-loathing, awkwardly looking off to the side. Where was her wisdom now, when Doddy had issues that hit too close to home? She bit her lip and looked visibly frustrated as they tried to praise her heart, at the expense of themselves. As Doddy hit their helmet with such force, engaging in self harm as they spoke, Caramel became louder and more emphatic. She was losing her cool, sounding sympathetic but frustrated at almost every word coming out of their mouth, venom a lot more potent when she saw it in a self-harming context, than when it was inflicted upon her.</em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, 02 December 2024 22:25">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1313218309105385583 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1313218309105385583><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, 02 December 2024 19:00">19:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“It’s <em>your</em> personality, not anyone else’s, isn’t it…?!

That it was <em>YOU</em> who said those things! Call yourself by whatever you like, it won’t change what’s inside that suit!”

<em>Her heart was racing, losing control of her emotions. What did it mean to have a persona? Who was the true “you”? Questions so close to her heart, ones that she answered with such… conviction… she couldn’t</em> <strong>not</strong> <em>say exactly what her heart desired. 

No matter how much they stuttered over their words, Caramel couldn’t help but hang on every syllable, especially when Fumi was mentioned. It gave her pause, cooling her down and dragging her back down to her a vulnerability that silenced her until they had finished speaking about their lost friend. Although her words remained poignant, she placed a reassuring hand on their helmet exactly where they had slapped themselves before, as if trying to heal illusory cracks.</em>

“Deja… was a person who left behind pain in her wake. A liar who deceived us all at the trial. But… she was also someone who grabbed my hand when I reached out, and who extended her own hand to yours. You can appreciate the love, compassion, and most of all <em>understanding</em> that she gave to you, but… don’t follow her into the grave. You want to thank her for all she’s done for you? It’s now <em>your responsibility</em> to fulfill her dreams, that’s how you can atone if you think you failed. No one… can revive those we have lost, so this is all that we can do.

It is your responsibility and you should fulfill it even if it means death.” Maybe she really had learned nothing from Fumi, casting off the sting of betrayal like a discarded jacket in the autumn, ignoring the small part of her begging to keep it for the chill to come. It was at least easier to revel in that feeling of despair like Doddy, but her compassion only grew for her when Deja was no longer around to make more mistakes. Seeing the person in front of her so fraught with feelings of regret made it difficult to consider all the things she left behind purely bad.

The shift to Uriel speaking as a mix between their fun-loving persona and a speaker of their true feelings only further proved her point. Even so, Uriel’s “arrival” unsettled her with all of the context given.</em>

“And I think… that just like I said, the fact that you can told about your friends so openly… admit that you hate yourself inside, it all shows the true Doddy behind the Uriel. When I tell people I live in a chocolate castle, or that I’m part eel, I’m not using the lore as a shield, it’s just fun! Shouldn’t Uriel the Martian be speaking of their space interests out of passion, instead than just as a trauma response? If there’s anything Rizzler taught me… <em>She laughs a little mid-sentence, the nickname even funnier post-mortem.</em> It’s that you should still plan events and enjoy yourself despite the situation, not delve into someone you’re not just to please people.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1313218497995735141 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1313218497995735141><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, 02 December 2024 19:01">19:01</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>Her goal wasn’t necessarily to stamp Uriel out of them, knowing that it is partly the reason why they’ve been able to survive for this long.

“I’m sorry… that you have such loathing for yourself. You think of yourself as weak or incapable inside and… maybe even a little selfish. You throw up your hands, talk about the planets, and people begin to smile. It brings you courage in this desperate situation, the others’ positive reactions fueling you to continue on.

Hah. Haha... Uriel liked Miku. Doddy didn&#39;t find much worth in synthesized music.

It didn&#39;t rumble their body like a guitar riff nor did it shake the earth like the crash of a symbol. The parsed together symbolic meaning of seeing synthesized sound mesh into a coherent shape reminded them all too much of what Uriel was. Nothing but synthesized audio that made up a sound wave in the peculair shape of a space suit. The helmet... the helmet was always part of the equation, Doddy never took it off. The suit was new. The backstory was new. The name. The identity. The way of talking. It was all so fake, synthetic, and listening to anything that wasn&#39;t a natural song made them sick and dizzy, scratching an uncomfortable itch right in the grooves of their soul. If a song, or in this case, a record, made you fall to your knees scratching and hitting yourself... was it really worth preserving? Uriel didn&#39;t give them purpose, Uriel gave them an escape. An escape from a reality they wish to turn back to, but for one reason or another, their body had melded into the persona, and the two were inseparable.

<em>Well... Caramel was waiting for the roar of an audience... wasn&#39;t she? When Caramel&#39;s hand touched the helmet, she could feel just by the touch how... how cold Doddy was.

But as her hand pressed against it, Doddy scotched back, a loud and ghastly gasp. Their hand friverously felt around the helmet. No breaches. Nobody saw what was under it, nobody knew nobody saw.

<em>Fulfill Fumi&#39;s dreams? How were they supposed to do that..? Doddy looked down at their hands, blue and gloved. For a hesitant moment, they took them off to stare and get the answers.

The distinct things her heart screamed out were so genuine it hurt, her persona’s incorporation into her subconscious a perfect match that helped her connect with others and brought her safety and joy. This “Uriel” was more internally defensive, joyful to others partly to stop themselves from being hurt, from being disliked, reducing themselves like a sound wave compressed into a shorter and shorter wavelength. How could embracing something you were not originally bring about such different feelings about themselves, while also causing them both to be on the verge of collapse of everything they had stood for?

Maybe Doddy would be better off without them. This amalgamation of the screeching technology sounds that represented Uriel took on a darker tonality in her mind, tainted by context that degraded innocent concepts like space and planets into those borne of trauma.

The freezing temperature of their helmet was a non-issue for her, it was actually perfect for circumstances to be alien and unknown to her, just so she could know that it was HER warmth that provided for those who needed her.

“You weren’t playing with us… you were dreaming. Dreaming of the person you’d like to be, falling into a fantasy where you didn’t hurt so much. I know you’re full of regret… you don’t know where to go from here. How you can fulfill Deja’s desires and dreams, only lost in your own head.

The risk wasn’t important if it meant not indulging would lead to the horrible thoughts to come back. As they laughed, Caramel found it similar to a crackling recorder filled with debris, an instrument designed to play such beautiful music faltering under a lack of care. And it was her job to fix it, to fix everything.</em>

“So… we’ve made some progress there, you know they’re a coping mechanism consciously. But, you’ve gotta see the flaw here, right? Even if you try to create this perfect persona, even if you <em>could</em> maintain it, then we’re missing sincerity… it’s the most important ingredient to be a person. And even Uriel wasn’t perfect, were they? You made us laugh but at least Doddy… can hug me back. They could read me beautiful lyrics, and even have tender moments like this… Uriel wasn’t capable of that.”

<em>As if to prove her point, she leaned into the hug even more, readjusting their arms into it was a proper embrace and giggling.</em>

“See? You’re hugging a Popstar, you, Doddy. If you wanna unify, take everything you like about Uriel that is healthy, that positive energy, the passion, and redirect it to your lyricism and actual interests! You know… let me tell you a story. I think it’s going to help you understand, show you that, no matter what you believe, it’s possible to separate yourself from the clutches of conformity, and remix your own life into something all your own.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1314674992671227935 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1314674992671227935><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, 06 December 2024 19:29">19:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>Caramel takes a deep breath, trying to calm herself in this dirty, foul-odored location, taking in her surroundings more as she centered herself. She took off her circular glasses, letting Uriel see her heterochromia more clearly. Perhaps this was her taking off her “helmet”.</em>

“Originally, Caramel Sweetney was… quite an intelligent and distant persona, never one to let others see her fragile heart. She didn’t just play video games, she <em>mastered</em> them, always using analysis and pattern recognition of her opponents to get her wins. She spent hours devising strategies for games like Counter Strike, Overwatch, and others, going into detail on every pixel of the map pool, every new exploit. It brought her incredible purpose to be objectively better than others at what she cared about, maybe ‘cause there were some… friend difficulties, early on. It was easier to feel superior than it was to address that she there was no company to share. Even being dirt-poor, she always tried to raise money for charities, partly because she wanted to do genuine good… and partly cause she wanted more people to like her.”

“Eventually, she met a V-Tuber named FavorFaye… someone who lifted her from her loneliness, allowed her to join her VRChat group. Letting her become her become more of herself as the straight man of the comedy group when they did skits opened her eyes, turning that same beautiful analytic mind she had for competitive games towards making cute costumes for her to wear in the virtual world… towards putting on silly voices… though she always kept her heart at bay. Her desperation for attention was always… embarrassing. She could let the world hear her laughter, but never the smile she believed was so ugly.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1314675068432941157 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1314675068432941157><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, 06 December 2024 19:29">19:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>Caramel couldn’t meet Doddy’s eyes anymore, the ex-space cadet and her universes apart as she told the story.</em>

But something happened one day that changed everything, an incident at a carnival… just like this one actually. It… changed me. In such a desperate state I… broke down. Everything that I thought was important, everything I thought people valued me for… it fell apart. How could I possibly join sessions when I didn’t even want to eat after that? Couldn’t even sleep? The days when I could finally afford to eat, but my dad finally left me for good?”

<em>Caramel blinked back a few tears… stay focused you idiot. Connect this back to Doddy, that’s why you’re here, isn’t it?</em>

“The emotional floodgates opened… and I didn’t find what I expected at all. I thought it would be sadness, and fear… but it was this profound happy bubbly feeling.

Creating magnificent treats and surfing through a river of whipped cream, dancing with the delicious dessert delicacies I’ve loved ever since I was a girl. I never abandoned my friends, I still did VRChat, I played my games, but I also started projecting myself in real life so people could see me making my food.”

<em>She finally put her glasses back on, looking at him with a relaxed posture. Like everything was going to be okay.</em>

“You… wanted to know how to reconcile your two sides? You use <em>this</em>. You hold on to this, and every time you feel you are diving into Uriel to cope rather than to enjoy, to dwell in the numbing feeling of excessive energy, rather than trying to incorporate that natural love into Doddy… when you do stumble squeeze this.

The ancious voice in their head chastised them, calling them all sorts of names and mean things. All of them were in the voices of other people, things they&#39;d been called all their life. Their hands retreated to the helmet as if to check for any more signs of damage. Their mind screamed out that they had a problem, they needed a Huston. Every Huston they had was gone. From the years before coming here, to the months spent in confinement in both the carnival and the space suit, Doddy had lost every bridge that was ever built towards them. Was it they who lit it ablaze? Holding the gasoline. The match. The fire. The spark that blew it all to hell. And here Caramel was, placing the bricks lovingly and gently, approaching slowly and not crossing the boundaries of their many walls, and Doddy was calling forth a meteor. Truthfully, Caramel&#39;s foot scraped over the edge of the largest marked border, littered with signs that warned of danger ahead, no returned, the ground littered with dirty razors and bathtubs tinted with red crimson. This wasn&#39;t a wall meant to be conquered. This wasn&#39;t a barrier that could be passed. It was actually the most fragile pillar that supported Doddy&#39;s even more fragile psyche.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1314685534009950279 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1314685534009950279><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, 06 December 2024 20:10">20:10</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

The very essence of their being forcing their mouth shut and scraping the words out of their vocal chords. They tried to scream it out, but a horrible and rotten cough came out instead. Uriel clawed at the suit, trying to at least peel that off so they could breathe. They slowed themself, heaving in breaths after their frightening episode. A few of the strings connecting their brain to earth severed there. Any further and they&#39;d be swimming with the stars.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>If everyone else can see the light why can&#39;t I-?!<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They blurted, voice catching tears desperately.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>Why d-do I have to be the one person who can&#39;t see anything good in myself...

<em>It didn&#39;t stop at sunken eyes. It was sunken cheek bones. Pale grey skin. Placid eyes that looked hollowed out. They looked skeletal. Yet they said they didn&#39;t hate their face. There was something else keeping Doddy held back on a thick iron collar.</em>

<strong>&quot;</strong>Dreaming... n-no it... its like... uhm... looki... looking at the stars. And... and saying how you see a funny pattern or something. Constelations are b-bull shit, they look nothing like what people say they do, but its fun to make stuff up... to be mindless. It helps with that regret, that... that everything...<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>As they managed to calm themself down, Doddy managed to slip their arms out of the suit. The tops of their hands and arms were covered in freckles, their skin was pale and the bones threatened to rip through their skinny frame. Doddy had told Fumi how they&#39;d eaten only once or twice this whole trip. They looked... anorexic. Around their wrists were ||tiny little white scars.

<em>Maybe it would be beneficial to help him. Doddy wanted to raise a kid with their beloved. There was never anything between the two rocky, or un-smooth. They had a wedding plan, they shared a ring. They were perfect, symphonies aligned and playing with the same harmonic tune that never stopped. Doddy always pictured a kid in their life. Blonde hair, maybe black, or brown, or white. Never anything else. Never anything but those options. Maybe they could take the kid under their wing. Teach him something... carry the torch for Fumi.</em>

<em>Caramel approached, hands wrapping around Doddy. Through their brownish flannel jacket, they could feel the warmth of her body. Doddy was incredibly cold, and felt like hugging sugar glass on the verge of shattering, but as Caramel shared the love, Doddy felt themself feeling something they hadn&#39;t in a very long time.</em>

<em>Love.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1314685809688969258 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1314685809688969258><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, 06 December 2024 20:12">20:12</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em>Not... Not romantic love. More platonic, or familial. The butterflies you get when someone finally notices you, or reaffirms all of the horrible things you feel and tells you &#39;it&#39;ll be okay&#39;. To feel that for the first time in a near decade... it... it made Doddy cry. The quiet sounds of hiccuping penetrated the visor, a very soft weeping like a mournful blue bird. Their hoarse voice heaved and huffed in gulps of desperate air, but their heart was always settled and reveling in the warmth. The tears slid under the helmet, rolling down their throat and absorbing into the fibers of their flannel clothing. This wasn&#39;t the reaction most had to hugging a popstar.</em>

<em>Their quiet sniffles and huffs carried throughout the story, and as the hug retreated, and as they finally got to see Caramel without her glasses. They looked longingly, wishing they had the same strength to do as she did. Remove the mask. Be seen. But they knew it was a fleeting pipe dream.</em>

<strong>&quot;</strong>Its... so difficult eating when you&#39;re grieving, isn&#39;t it?<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They tried to laugh along at the horribleness of that idea.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1314685854819549214 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1314685854819549214><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, 06 December 2024 20:12">20:12</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em>Floodgates controlled how much water flowed through. Sometimes, with the right amount of water, you could have a lovely stream that flowed and brought life along with it. You could have fantastical nature sprout up everywhere. Humans who engaged with it and saw it for what it was. But if they opened too wide, it killed everything, drowning it in ferocious tides that ripped away the life that which it brought. It would never grow back the same vibrancy it once had. Thats the floodgates Doddy knew. Ripping rapids and churning tides. Not candy land. More like a song played with broken glass bottle drums and salt shaker harmonicas right into someone&#39;s eye.</em>

<em>Doddy&#39;s palm opened up, accepting the earring. It landed in their hand and it felt as if Doddy held the weight of the world with them. Their hand retracted close to their chest, placed against their heart as they shivered again. Another round of tears wanted to start, but Doddy hadn&#39;t drank enough to produce any. Only salt stinging their eyes.</em>

<strong>&quot;</strong>Fumi...<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They whimpered.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>Why... why g-give this to me? F-for what?<strong>&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>She was caught enough in her feelings and introspection to be completely unaware of Uriel’s nervousness at her caution, usually relying on facial cues and body language that was consciously and effectively concealed by the space person get-up. The tape over their helmet had made an impression on Caramel before, and as their hands went to their helmet as if trying to protect from a beating, her recoiled reaction felt almost necessary. Flickers of guilt played across her face as she frowned, this now socially obvious self-protective mechanism making her feel like she had made a major mistake by mentioning the helmet at all. Were the many sloppy repairs of the costume due to the self-harming tendencies that seemed ever-present within them? Either way, the push and pull of affection and unease between them conjured up the image of a game of tug-of-war on a rickety bridge over a swift river. It was a reminder that she couldn’t pull with all of her might, that it would take a gentler hand guided by patience to bring them closer to the center of the bridge, without risking them falling between the planks into the sea of mental anguish below. 

Caramel battled with this feeling, this restraint that she had to show in comforting them, finding it hard to adapt in the very same way it was hard to appeal to Chatter; the two individuals had specific trauma with boundaries that required more distance for effective relationships with them. She was no therapist, and she certainly couldn’t overcome her own nature, continuing to try to work with Doddy no matter how much razor wire cut into her heels. That was what it meant to be a person that she was proud of, what it meant to be a hero. Her hands released him every which way, whether that be a hand on their shoulder or a hug, temporarily ceasing anything that could cause distress.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1315184086951923733 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1315184086951923733><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, 08 December 2024 05:12">05:12</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“H-Hey, that’s fine!

<em>Were they having a panic attack?! Was she effectively going to be killing someone with a heart attack through trauma unlocking?! Caramel was trying not to catastrophize, but she felt like every time she took one step forward, she tripped two steps into a hole, then a pit, then a thorny ditch ass-backwards. Clearly, their nervousness was contagious, Caramel reaching out her hands only to hold herself back in the very next second, seeing someone in distress, and then remembering that she needed to try something else when her mind naturally went for hugs.</em>

“H-Hey just… listen… you’re just… you’re not thinking straight. You’re trying to let out a torrent of emotions for the first time that has been building up like a pool of water behind a dam. L-Listen maybe there’s some mental illness here, okay? It’s not that you’re not good but clearly there’s some self-esteem issues, and some body dysmorphia as well. You look at yourself, your appearance and who you think you are inside, and you can’t see yourself objectively. The o-only way to get better is to start making very slow steps, not like taking off your helmet right <em>now</em>, but start talking about the things you like about <em>Doddy</em>, even if it’s small things.

At least there would be more understanding between them, though she hoped her words coming up soon would connect on a deeper level. The appearance of genuine flesh, absent of the false costume, began to turn the mood around. There wasn’t any shortage of tough sights to see underneath, from skin that looked taunt enough to snap off their pointy bones, and markings of self-abuse that reminded her of some of her cubs. A familiar unspoken compassion grew in her eyes, you could almost read the emotion on her face like a book. It was that of relief. The real them was laid bare in front of her, and a chance at helping the lost soul was given to her on a silver platter. She wouldn’t let her expression show even a hint of distress at the state they were in, only continuing in the conversation and offering them one of her chocolates to eat later. One could never have too much chocolate after all! A nice side-effect was the high amount of calories, which their dearly malnourished lyricist sorely needed.</em>

“It wasn’t that she had a child, it’s that she <em>has</em> a child. An innocent young boy who loves his mother so dearly, and needs guidance and comfort. Now, it’s your turn. Your primary mission isn’t to fly to a distant galaxy, or follow in the path of famous lyricists. It’s your new life’s goal to find and take care of this boy, and raise them as your own. I don’t know how I feel about religion personally, it’s hard to think about that stuff. But what I do believe is that it is the responsibility of those close to the fallen to carry on what they wanted, that their will <em>should</em> survive beyond their body’s expiration date.

“You know what I value about myself? The cheerful energy that I bring when others are sad, the ability to bounce back no matter the trouble I run into. But in order to get here, I had to come at it from a place of honesty and growth, I display my sincere emotions on my face and hope to inspire others. I’m really not that complicated, I’m just a lil’ silly lady and wanna cause some innocent trouble! So, when I can help someone even just a little bit, let them see the beauty I see in others in themselves like a new sunset breaking through a thick mist, it’s a special moment of clarity for both of us.

<em>Throughout her time here, Caramel had undergone a great number of ordeals like the others, and she had changed as a result. But she had never let the sparkly energy fade away for long, always making a comeback to at least try to bring a smile to the faces of the others.

Yes, Doddy&#39;s helmet protected against their self harming tendancies; punching themself and face palming hard enough to cave their skull in was one thing it did, but it went further into protecting what was under the helmet. The face obscured by a black deeper than a new moon. Even gentler hands faltered with the helmet. Building a bridge takes a much longer time, and Doddy was much too flighty to commit to building one so fast. Yet... at the same time, much like the roots of a vegetable, Doddy&#39;s severed strings reached outwards to wrap and intertwine with Caramel&#39;s. They were trying at least, they were thinking about it. Thinking about it was the first step to recovery, right? They&#39;d attended a rock show, the lead singer talked about his struggles to the crowd as a heartfelt tribute to his latest album. He said the first few notes of your song are the ones that dictate the future path you can go down, the building blocks of the house you forge fueled by friendship. These must be the first gentle strings, weaving very slowly to form a beautiful quilt.</em>

<strong>&quot;</strong>I-I&#39;m... doing great...<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>Doddy repeated. Softly. Like it was a gentle thought that was meant to be sheltered and loved. They hiccuped softly, dry tears stinging their eyes as... as what might be a smile slowly spread behind the visor.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>I&#39;m doing great.<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They repeated as if it was the refrain in a song. Their breathing slowed down, the storm of anxiety quelled long enough for Caramel to peer into the eye of it all. One lone lyricist who was ready to accept whatever branch grew towards them.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1316130349540966530 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1316130349540966530><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, 10 December 2024 19:52">19:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em>Doddy wanted to explain it to Caramel. Their hands wrapped around their ukelele, which at this time was still in tact. Yes, Doddy could explain this in the perfect way. They could write an ode, an ode to Uriel right here on this spot for Caramel to understand. She was right, body dysmorphia. But the way it affected Doddy was so inherenty fused to their soul that a professional welder might as well have blow torched the iron gate shut and let it cool to hardened steel. They hesitated though, blood turning to pure ice as their fingers met the strings. Were they... really about to do this? Their visor dimmed considerably like a one way mirror, locking out Caramel from sight and leaving Doddy in only the hollow black globe kept inside of their shell. Nobody would get it. Nobody would understand like he did. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody...</em>

<strong>&quot;</strong>A-am I able to... like... even do that? I don&#39;t know if I can survive. I&#39;ve never fought... or tried to solve a murder on my own... I...<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They sighed, their will escaping as a spirit. But just as quickly Doddy tried to employ some of that lingering positivity Caramel radiated.

Fumi&#39;s will won&#39;t die with her... N-neither will Yuri&#39;s, o-or anyone&#39;s here. Me... me and you can carry the burden together th-though, right? I&#39;m uhm. Pretty... uhm. Shrimpy?

Glass bones paper skin kinda shrimpy, hehe...<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>Doddy scratched the back of their helmet like it was a scalp.The gap between the helmet&#39;s bars seemed to widen more and more, revealing a warmth that wasn&#39;t able to vent out of them before. It was working, Caramel&#39;s sweet exterior was finally getting to the center of the Doddy tootsie pop.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1316130409024847952 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1316130409024847952><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, 10 December 2024 19:52">19:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em>The mirror Caramel pointed at them was the final straw.</em>

<em>Doddy saw their face in the mirror. Not the helmet. Their face. They saw past the exterior, they saw exactly who they were under that helmet. Lables stuck to their helmet like &#39;Uriel&#39; and &#39;Delusional&#39; withered away along with the glass exterior of the visor, leaving naught but Doddy S. Martins in their wake. They whispered their name to themself. Their fingers glided over their ukelele. The soft strums of music filled the room on impulse. They didn&#39;t realize that &#39;Hawk Tuah&#39; was written on there immediately, but when they did see it the moment disappeared in the ripples of their laughter. They laughed gently, and then harder, until their sad tears turned to happy ones. Doddy&#39;s broken laugh from a decade of smoking didn&#39;t seem all that broken anymore, it carried with it a happy bliss that was different from Uriel&#39;s. They weren&#39;t getting someone to laugh at them, nor were they being stupid. They were being joyful, for the first time in ages.</em>

<strong>&quot;</strong>G-god thats...<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They said between a snicker.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>H-how did that get me thats... so fucking stupid-<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They didn&#39;t mean the harsh words, it came from a place of warmth and love after all.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>Hot Tuah, spit on that sun.<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They tried and failed to make a funny joke, but it didn&#39;t matter. A bit of that joy from Uriel escaped out of the carapace of Doddy&#39;s helmet. A moment of joy where they weren&#39;t playing a character or a facade of happiness, but instead a moment where Doddy displayed full capability of being autonomous over their joy. No longer shackled, wrists feeling light and body being free.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1316130539752919060 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1316130539752919060><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, 10 December 2024 19:52">19:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em>They arrived back to earth on blue boots and orange space suits.</em>

<strong>&quot;</strong>Uhm... I w-will...<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>Their grip loosened on the earring, they cupped it gently, looking down at it. The gold reflected in the visor in perfect picture, none of the black expanse absorbing it. Doddy saw it clearly.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>I&#39;m uh. I&#39;m here for... for you too, Caramel.<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>Their helmet was finally able to recognize Caramel for herself now too. It saw what she showed, they recognized what it meant, and how the two were in a very similar dam to each other. Their grip on the ukelele felt less and less icy, their heart pumped warmth to their cheeks as a twang of guilt rumbled upwards. They didn&#39;t want to have pushed Caramel to show this, no no no not at all. She didn&#39;t have to give them anything in return, really it was all okay.</em>

<em>But their anxiety quelled and Doddy remained still.</em>

<strong>&quot;</strong>I-I&#39;ll be there. I&#39;ll play the sickest riff on an instrument you&#39;ve ever heard. Doddy Martins, finally playing one of their songs on a stage. Even if its for one person-! Its... like... worth it. &#39;Cause you matter.<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They lifted their hand up, giving a solitary thumbs up that gleamed with energy. That rock and roll vibe started to ebb and flow into Doddy again. It was finally time for the space cadet to return to earth, and to bury Uriel in the pasture.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Who was to say that she herself wouldn’t fall off, rather than just them? The paltry life raft below covered in tears from a girl expected to be perfect had already been bruised and beaten, barely unable to not be swept away by the current. In diving into the stream of drama of a person so intently, diving headlong into the asteroid belt, was she destined to crash down back to earth as a comet, flaming and causing disaster wherever she landed? The shaky steps forward on the shaky path from one end of the river to the other encouraged her, the mere consideration that they had shown her as a sign of trust. It made her efforts feel validated. It was like trying to coax an abused stray animal over to her side, a certain blonde golden retriever bringing her strength when she first brought them into her household as a friend. At least how she saw it, it was a contradiction of feeling for both her pet and Doddy; a defensiveness born of self-protectiveness turned up to eleven, yet wanting a few particular individuals to have a key to easily slip past their defenses. But it was always important to those who were hurting to have that control, for the door to have a lock no matter what. As she begin to hear positive self-affirmations, she chose to believe they were genuine attempts at change, trying to be encouraging with an open posture and slow, controlled movements. With a deep breath, Caramel turned the key.</em>

“There there~ Of course you’re doing great, you’re Sixth, hero to all who need a friend.

What beautiful sounds coming from beneath the glassy and smooth surface of the helmet, the song of honesty was far more healing than any never-ending space rant would ever be. She placed a hand on her chest close to her heart, a relieved breath escaping from her. It would seem they had finally reached the edge of the trauma, and therefore, a lessening of the intense pain that had radiated from them like a distress call. It didn’t mean that the storm had ended within them, that their mental illness had been ‘fixed’, but it did feel like there was hope. “One sole song to quell the darkness”, she thought to herself as she watched their hands find their way to the instrument, nodding with her hands in an adorable prayer pose. She tilted her downturned head up with a winking face at them. Her attempt at being encouraging.</em>

It may have been her sense of pride, but she felt convinced by that, watching little motions like a little helmet scratch as evidence of their growing connection. In this world of despair, it was a struggle for happiness and the people sharing their weakness would have been just fine with her, as long as they didn’t spread it like a mantra and act self-superior! Proclaiming that the world had problems but doing nothing about it, refusing to look inward unlike Sixth and her, was an insult to everything they had gone through.

Further along in the conversation, she had felt blessed with that giggly silly energy that she got random bursts of at times, looking ever so amused at her little prank. She didn’t really expect it to get them anywhere, only satisfying the child within her who wanted to cause trouble, a rarity in this place where she hadn’t pulled a single trick. The positive reaction was unexpected, her face becoming a little flushed in embarrassment but also with a colorful joy, rewarded with beautiful music in reply to her brainrot.

She would make sure to sent them later!

At the benevolent handling of the artifact that represented their friend, she looked pleased at the level of respect shown, the gold now treasured not for its monetary worth, but its emotional value. It made showing them the secret peeking beneath the cotton mentally easier, waving off their concerned guilty looks at her exposing such a thing with a ‘don’t worry about it sweetie’ kind of attitude. She clarified her position at their unspoken question, an inquiry that she was sure Sixth had.

<em>Caramel returned the thumbs up like they were having a duel, but her hand was getting closer and closer to theirs.

She curled around them like a kitty-cat despite the dog ears, self-satisfied with another friend made and a heart mended! She made satisfactory noises as she glomped onto them, nestling into their shoulder and surrounding themselves with blankets and pillows and everything soft and nice.

Hero is. Kinda a new thing to me. I always fancied myself more of a. Uhm. Like a vigilante. A lot of rock and metal mentality is based on uhm... defying what others think. Being yourself. Being authentic. Helping others do the same, and tearing down the shits who get in your way of that.<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>Doddy strummed the ukelele a little harder. The twang had more spice in it, a fire starting to erupt that played in Doddy&#39;s soul. Their heart strings sand a beautiful song just then, with golden spit pouring from their finger tips and along the strings of the instrument in a powerful resounding strum.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>Guess I&#39;ve... been kinda un-like that for a while.<strong>&quot;</strong>

<em>But now Doddy&#39;s shackles had burned away. They could hear the sound of a concert starting. Off in the distance was a light; neon colored and strobing, over a stage cloaked in fake fog and a crowd of adoring fans waiting for them. This time the crowds wouldn&#39;t cheer Uriel. They&#39;d cheer Doddy. They never went on stage with Daniel, but the desire had always been there. The other desire of remaining hidden and safe was gone now, the only beacon that shown in their helmet&#39;s visor was the one in the middle of a stage.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1317641935044739253 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1317641935044739253><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, 14 December 2024 23:58">23:58</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<strong>&quot;</strong>A song..? Yeah uhm. Yeah I did.<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>But they hesitated again. They pushed against a lump in their throat that threatened to stop their wheels turning head on. Their heart&#39;s song was still thoroughly trapped in a bird cage, needing one final and hard PUSH to escape through. Doddy&#39;s heart beat thudded, resounding in the empty air. It was the seconds before the drummer hit their drums, or the guitarist plucked a string, right as the microphone went dead and the crowd froze with anticipation. Doddy&#39;s chest rose and fell with each beat of their heart. But then they looked up. Their visor caught Caramel in it... her reassuring smile, the nickname &#39;Sixth&#39;. For a second, Doddy could swear they saw some sort of glowing star. Bright, brilliant, golden even. It was far off in the distance, but if Doddy played loud enough, even the lonely little star could feel the song inside of it.</em>

<strong>&quot;</strong>Its uhm...<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>Their hands still sweat nervously. Stage fright wasn&#39;t just a single step or bump in a road. But... the road was getting clearer, slowly.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>Gonna be free verse. &#39;Cause I can&#39;t make something platinum on the spot. Writing makes it easier but uhm... my process involves self isolation s-so... Uhm...<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They trembled over their words and released a shaky sigh.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>Guess its more like... an ode. An Ode to Uriel.<strong>&quot;</strong>

<em>Their fingers played the instrument softly.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1317642067345936384 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1317642067345936384><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, 14 December 2024 23:59">23:59</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<strong>&quot;</strong>They were a space cadet, born looking at the stars. Though they always looked past them, hoping to go... uhm... fars?<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>Their voice cracked in confusion. Rhyming on the fly was something saved more for a diss rapper than a lyricist.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>Fuck uhm. Their mother shot further, always outta reach. But her streak in the sky always radiated off of the kid. Everyone around them knew her name, knew her shame, and laid all the consequence on Uriel to blame. Every single one of them in that cold starry sky, even as Uriel escaped it left them with one question... why...<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They slowly got into a flow. They... recognized how cringe this was, giving their whole origin sttory in a song about someone unrelated to them, about a space cadet instead of a kid from Canada. But it was also oddly cathartic.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>SO! So. They escaped to Mars. Met a new colony, they all played mad bars. They saw a mothman, a sight for sore eyes. He was like a glowing ball, a Uriel in the skies.<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They paused the song playing for a moment.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>Uriel is uhm. It means a glowing orb of fire, kinda. So like... yeah.<strong>&quot;</strong>

<em>They cleared their throat and continued.</em>

<strong>&quot;</strong>But the two grew so close that... mothman asked a question. He pulled them in,  whispered something that left an air of tension...<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They lingered on the note. All of a sudden their finger snuffed the key and they sighed.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1317642124417826887 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1317642124417826887><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, 14 December 2024 23:59">23:59</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<strong>&quot;</strong>Uhm. He pulled the visor up. And the little alien ran away, leaving him behind without... Uhm...<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>Their notes became discordant.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>Hey uhm. How about... we take a recess for now instead. Can&#39;t figure out my mojo on the fly right now, too discombobulated from this like. Circus and stuff.<strong>&quot;</strong>

<em>Doddy returned to the conversation and placed their ukelele on the side.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>Nathan? For real? Me and him are like. He&#39;s. Too similar to Daniel sometimes, HEH. In a uhm. Good way. Actually, Daniel always wanted to be the ultimate guitarist. Its a little uncanny being around him sometimes. B-BUT. But. If you think it&#39;ll be fun? Then. Yeah, I&#39;ll ask him some time. Me and Nathan jamming it out.<strong>&quot;</strong>

<em>The warmth of their body started to come back out. No longer did Doddy feel like a corpse, but their heart beat brought fresh blood to their veins and a smile on their hidden face.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>Yeah. I dunno if I got to ever uhm. Talk to someone... so deeply for... years actually...<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They let out a happy exhalation.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>Its nice to be me again. And it was... nice to be me with Caramel.<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They looked up, had moving upwards too and offering a consolatory fist bump.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>You wanna be Doddy Martins&#39; first real fan?

<em>She went to reach for the ukulele but she thought better of it, knowing that it was probably a symbol of something far more important than a simple musical instrument. The fulfillment from redeeming another person, at least in her mind, coaxed the excitement from her fragile soul, allowing her to finally chill in the lair. It gave her an idea for another shelter near her old burnt tent, wondering if Doddy would write a little ditty for an audience of two while surrounded by walls of compacted dirt. Looking over the way Doddy’s body shifted back and forth, the way they drifted over every string with elegance now, but a few moments of hesitation at first, like they were finding their footing again, made her feel like she could could understand them. A new… friend, even when she hadn’t had the courage to make more after Deja’s trial. She couldn’t help but grin, their connection cemented.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1321387769268015115 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1321387769268015115><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, 25 December 2024 08:03">08:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>Helmet aside, she knew the heart of a star; Someone who could thrive under the spotlight, even if the rainbow of colors was blinding and reflecting off of their helmet.

For Sixth now, experiencing what it was like to authentically be one without the baggage of maintaining a warped need to explore the stars, it must have been a profound rebirth that let them define their own popularity on their terms. Relating their progress to her own rebranding early on when she took on her sister’s dream, it felt like she was recreating something beautiful from the pieces of broken pottery. Pumping her fist into the air at the knowledge of a melody that they had written, she encouragingly tilted her head and put her hands back in her lap in anticipation.</em>

The way she saw it, even the few paltry notes that were hastily strung together were far grander than a symphony when there was a deeper-meaning and motivation behind a song beyond being a cash-grab. Though, even if the song would rely on their lips alone, it didn’t mean that she couldn’t be encouraging, especially when, for the first time, it felt that Doddy was looking at her rather than through her. It wasn’t the way an average audience member who watched her laughed at her jokes and scoffed at her cringy antics, not a person who saw her as just the icon presented rather than a complicated human being with nuances underneath. Both her light and dark sides were as clear as could be to everyone now, but few could understand the regret and the guilt, the determination and loyalty that survived beyond death. Sixth might be one of the few people left who were beginning to see the real her, even if just a little. Clapping along to the beat unabashedly, Caramel gyrated back and forth, a roly-poly of a fellow entertainer trying to catch a vibe. Now, it was her turn in the audience.

What mattered wasn’t if the details were meant to be taken literally, but the emotions behind each statement, deciphering how these experiences shaped Sixth as a person. Caramel was very expressive throughout the entire tale, treating it more like an origin story than a song. Her eyes squinted and her brow knitted itself tighter as she heard the tale of how they were hurt as a result of a parental figure in their life, the way that society at large redirected their anger towards an unwitting victim. Even as the story became ‘more positive’ when speaking about space, her prior knowledge about what that meant to Doddy over Uriel gave her pause, the same unpleasant look remaining until this moth man was mentioned. Trying to imagine the way the guitarist actually looked, she visualized a young twenty-something that looked similar to Nathan, the other guitarist that she knew here. She let her features rest, her closed eyes and soothing smile reflecting the positive and romantic emotions that were just beginning to occur to her with her special bandana-wearing someone Her humming continued as her mood improved, though the twist about the failed engagement left her with a worried but supportive expression, especially as they finally cut themselves off.

You know, it’s like I always have said… I’d rather a thousand truthful Springs empty of life, than a single lively warm Winter of deception. I don’t know what it’s like to be rejected just cause of who I’m related to really… I can sympathize though, and why those experiences, among others I’m sure, lead you to where you are. I’m just so happy… you were able to express it like this! A melody over an unrelenting rant that just wasn’t you… hehe, you really would be nice to have in a concert!”

<em>Hope for the future was a rare thing in a place like this, but she was starting to regain it, wondering if songs like this would also be a way of the future, and not just a look back to the past. Ballads of the heroes who took down the villainous organization who kidnapped them were in order; a chorus of pure grit and valor. If Sixth could keep this up, stepping away from coping mechanisms that reminded both of them about the demons of their collective pasts, then maybe it wasn’t wrong to keep a positive mindset as they went forward.</em>

“And I don’t wanna hear a single line more of the song till it’s complete and you can perform it to me! Oh, and Pirate Lady can be on my side listening, and maybe you could get Nathan to coordinate with you on your end too! Try to think of his similarities with Daniel as them being two kindred spirits, another friend who could strum their way into the heart of a revived lyricist.

Saving someone was already proof-positive that she wasn’t useless by herself, that she could pick up and guide those who were lost with her own merits, not just when merely disguised behind an avatar, a screen, and a reputation started before she had ever touched a computer. As they offered a fist bump, Caramel smirked and was reminded of an important gesture to her brand. With a closed fist, she lightly pounded the base of her neck twice, then brought two fingers to her lips, tapping them the same way.

She wanted to impress upon them that they had listened intently and that this wasn’t a mere acquaintanceship anymore. Taking a little breath, she continues.</em>

“But for real… it means a lot that you opened up to me. I know it isn’t easy, hiding behind a mask, always having your guard up. Being hurt by others. It also… means something to me to hear that you want to be with me, I mean, I don’t have access to all the things that people usually love about me here. No streaming equipment or fresh desserts that aren’t weeks old… so to hear you like my personality, that I’m trustworthy? It makes me proud to be Caramel… if that makes any sense. I have one last thing for you and… I think it’ll give you the answer to the question you asked for in a far better way than a few words would do.”

<em>Now she really was catching his breath, inhaling and exhaling in a controlled way, steadying the beating of her heart into a consistent rhythm the best that she could. When her eyes were closed like this and she looked so concentrated so suddenly, it was a stark reminder that she was a professional in her career. She had genuine, hard-earned skills that were hard to come by for those who hadn’t worked extremely hard for them. Taking their hand, Caramel let her eyelashes flutter and come alive, her shining irises full of vibrancy, like fireflies were dancing amongst the pink and blue hues. Her hand slowly went to Doddy’s, holding their hand if they would allow it, like two friends walking in the park together. Unexpectedly, a silky-smooth singing voice rang out from her, letting out music formed entirely from her imagination.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1321388408936861778 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1321388408936861778><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, 25 December 2024 08:05">08:05</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“A testament to the star-seeker, who looks at the sky up high. Finding the wonder they were seeking inside, they decided to never say any more painful goodbyes. A value within that couldn’t be bought or sold, to their friend Caramel, it was as valuable as gold. Blamed for sins of family they held so dear, they cowered silently, crying out in fear. What could another space cadet do, persecuted, and under such a threat? Reach out to a lover so tender, their passion undisputed. A proposal snuffed and their feelings suppressed, they thought it was over, beginning to obsess. But leaving a carnival most foul with morals oft leached, they took heart in the lessons learned, a breakthrough reached. Leaving through the gate rather than space, progress had been made, in small part from a silly girl who was all dressed in lace. Smiling at them with strength, she held a hope most dear, that they realized that the light had been inside them the entire time, and that they had no reason to shed tears.”

<em>A feminine and sweet voice calling out to complement Doddy’s earlier lyrics, singing out towards them to return the feelings that they had allowed Caramel to share in. She snuggled closer once more, basically surrounding the poor genderless being with her limbs, avoiding nothing except for their helmet. They loudly yawned once again, getting in this cycle of feeling as comfortable as a pea in its pod, as a pig in its blanket, when it was just the two of them. Caramel hoped the message, their true feelings towards Sixth, would bring them some peace not only for the past, but for what could happen in the future.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Record label or vigilante label, I don&#39;t really care which... I&#39;ll make sure this little space cadet can still swing their ship over to your side of the galaxy, &#39;kay?<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>Doddy laughed softly, the cigarette ash in their vocal chords finally vanishing and leaving the warm embers behind that started the cig in the first place. The glow of their smile managed to shine through the helmet visor, rays cast through a black sea to penetrate the heart of everyone who knew it was there. Their gloved hands squeezed the wooden instrument with love, laughing again once more. This moment... they wanted it to last as long as it possibly could, they didn&#39;t want their grip to slip on it, ever.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>A good role model never leaves anyone behind...<strong>&quot;</strong>

<em>The ukelele was a lot to Doddy, she was right. It was a symbol of their love to Daniel, someone they never let go of. They loved him so much... it hurt to think about him, but at the same time, it was so... so... so lovely to picture the two of them. A nice life together. Both still earned the same money from their record deals and hit songs that played in malls all through the world. No agent was greedy enough to rake the money they&#39;d earned together. They held the ukelele close... Maybe when this was all over, the strength Caramel instilled in Doddy would be enough to go see Daniel again. Not to re-establish the bridge, but to salvage what was burnt. Fix what needed to be fixed for both ends of the river to function as they once did. Once water began to flow, no matter if the ends of the rivers flowed different directions, the both of them could have the closure they needed. The strings on this ukelele may sever, but the connection it meant to both parties would never vanish.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1324603977974681691 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1324603977974681691><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, 03 January 2025 05:03">05:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<strong>&quot;</strong>... You&#39;re a good lyricist, Carm.<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They complimented after her melody subsided.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>Your voice and jams are just as sweet as your name, heh. You uh... You wanna go to a concert together sometime? Like, friend thing, friends go on like, friend-dates. What am I talking about, thats just hanging out... uff...<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They face palmed, bare flesh touching the helmet without contempt for the first time.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>I&#39;m a mess, I should see more people like, more often.<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>Reveling in their own loneliness, Doddy slowly stood up. Their boots were heavy against the wooden floor panneling of the &#39;house&#39;. The crude approximation that wore the facade of a home, it reminded Doddy of themself a bit. By leaving this place... Doddy was cementing themself a positive path to the future.</em>

<em>They pasued themself, and turned down to look at Caramel. No doubt, their eyes were full of empathy for her. They didn&#39;t know the true depth of her toils, but knowing someone was there..? It was all that counted. Nobody could count the millions of stars in the sky, or the billions of trillions deep in space. But it was easy to count the teeth in a smile, or the number of interlocking arms in a hug. Their hand picked their small instrument up with care, and sighed softly. This was probably the last audience it would hear. Not that Doddy knew it would ever break, but they had the feeling that if they didn&#39;t die, they&#39;d live long enough to see Akira smash it to bits.</em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, 03 January 2025 05:04">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1324603992625512549 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1324603992625512549><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, 03 January 2025 05:03">05:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<strong>&quot;</strong>Thanks to listening to the sonet of a space cadet. Coming to an album store near you in 2025. When we&#39;re all outta here. I&#39;ll write the full thing down, you&#39;ll be the first to hear about it.<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>They waved a hand and started to step forward, pausing when they realized how rude it was to step away and not actually give a proper goodbye.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>Uhm. Hey I&#39;m. Probably gonna go. Its... its been a long convo and stuff. Like, a good one, but I&#39;m tired dudette... yet kinda like... relaxed too? I dunno, its a nice kinda tired. I don&#39;t feel labored, just relaxed, and so at peace I could just like....<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>Their hand stretched out and they dramatically fell towards the bed, the most expression they&#39;ve given all night.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>Crash out I guess. Thats what people say and stuff. Yeah... crashing out...<strong>&quot;</strong> <em>As soon as they hit the bed they were crawling up again, hunched slightly and rubbing their neck. That wasn&#39;t comfortable, falling onto a hard helmet like theirs.</em> <strong>&quot;</strong>... Thanks, Carm. Like... I&#39;ve said it a million times already but... thanks.<strong>&quot;</strong>

<em>The message was recieved. Copied. Noted down and stored in the black box of their heart. Doddy plicked the strings a few more times in Caramel&#39;s honor, before they departed. The space ship left the station smoothly, riding high. Higher than it had before. Off the charts, breaking platinum, sailing the milkyway. Doddy was gone, but the impact they&#39;d left when crashing into planet Caramel left a crater that could never be forgotten. A space cadet entered the room today.</em>

<em>But the space cadet left as a lyricist.</em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, 03 January 2025 05:04">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>
