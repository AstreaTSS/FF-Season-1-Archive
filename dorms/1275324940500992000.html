The <strong>beds</strong> are a complete mess, pillows and blankets are scattered everywhere and sort of resemble a nest. It&#39;s not much different from the rest of the room, the dark blackout curtains only giving way to a little bit of light to shine on the mess that covers the floor.

However, in the middle of the room is a <strong>blue flower</strong> in a vase covered by glass. Somehow it blooms beautifully.

For someone so energetic, it was a more calming atmosphere that she engaged with and contributed to, the late night skies reminding her of her conversation with Mx. Imposter. It was so nice to meet another friend, one who had seen clear skies that she never had much time to experience.

She tripped over multiple blankets and pillows that covered the floor, letting out a squeaking noise upon hitting the soft material that completely showed just how uncool she was, even when relaxed. She slowly tumbled and rolled across the mound of blankets, finding herself next to the woman who was a giant in comparison to her. She craned her neck up to look at her features, the height difference almost comical despite Caramel seeming to weigh more than she looked from a distance. Her voice was friendly and clear as she looked into her hurt and puffy eyes, a bright disposition that rivaled the sun’s.</em>

“Musta been tough on ya to do that, I getchu. I make treats for a living, you should have this. It’ll remind ya of home~”

<em>She placed a small package at her feet, not wanting to impose, foil paper covering a small rectangular package.

Memories of a similar tune flashed in her mind, a large man at the foot of twin-sized pink bed having such a similar ring to it. That man who helped her sleep during those times when he really couldn’t afford to be there. The nostalgia just made her even more emotional, leading to a little gasp as she tried to choke back more of her crying. Her vision became blurry, shielding part of her face with a blanket on the side where the camera was pointing. The audience shouldn’t have to bear with their happy idol not being her best self for them.</em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, 20 October 2024 19:01">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1297635631471530005 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1297635631471530005><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, 20 October 2024 19:00">19:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“You’re v-very sweet, like a g-guardian, even when you’re in p-pain too.

<em>She squeezed her hand one more time, interlacing their fingers and letting the other woman know that she was still there for her two. Caramel finally let go to crawl and search around the room, but couldn’t stop looking back at the lady, wanting nothing more than to lay back there and not worry about anything. She took her time searching all of the beds, flipping over all the blankets and pillows, even checking pillowcases for any coins that she could find. Her movements were weak and slower, trying not to embarrass herself even further in front of Riley by sobbing openly.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Hey, hey... it&#39;s okay. Thank you for thinking I&#39;m sweet, but please don&#39;t overexert yourself. I&#39;m really not in that much pain...my shock wasn&#39;t even that bad.&quot; <em>She shrugs; she has a high constitution anyway, so she takes pain better than most.</em>

&quot;Come back over here, please? Your body needs to rest at least for a little while longer. Electric shocks can cause severe damage if not healed properly&quot; 

*She pats the bed beside her and picks up the foil-wrapped chocolate. She begins to unwrapp it and breaks off two pieces, offering one to Carmel.

Caramel took a second to wipe her face of all tears that she could, trying to be as subtle as she could but still blatantly facing away from Riley for at least thirty seconds while getting herself together. She turns back to her with stained red cheeks, totally not looking like she had just bawled her eyes out in front of essentially the entire world. She begins to crawl back towards the kind lady, the expression on her face one of pained joy, like an injured bird who had just been hand-delivered its favorite birdseed. It was atypical for someone to look, even if it looked somewhat forced, that positive after being shocked that hard. Perhaps this was how Caramel showed “strength”.</em>

“I’m trying not to, y’know? I think resting can be good but like, I just wonder what’s going on out there with the other persons. But… you’re not the <em>worst</em> person to talk to or anything, s-so that’s something. Maybe we can stay awhile.”

<em>Caramel attempted to be cheeky, sticking out her tongue and winking at her. Being silly like this actually really helped her come back to herself mentally. After Riley asked her to come back to her physically, Caramel begins to go a little faster towards the the comforting presence, diving into the covers like a silly cat who was pouncing on an imaginary mouse. She leaned her shoulder on hers instead of going on her lap again in an effort to not be</em> <strong>too</strong> <em>clingy, she always had been told she got attached too quickly.

<em>Outwardly, she was looking a lot better at this point, seeming to enjoy being with someone that acted the way that she did. She laid on her stomach right in front of Riley now, letting her see her tablet over her shoulder as she texted the group chat and chilled with her for awhile. Her mind was a bit adrift as she opened up the bounties page at last, zooming in so she could see the exact text. She could totally get the coin-spending bounty, and the one right below… there would be a great opportunity for Riley herself to get bounty number four while she got the third bounty. The problem was she couldn’t talk about this idea aloud, as that would be Caramel consenting. She squeezed her hand tightly and leaned into it, communicating a little bit more affection in gratefulness to all that she did.</em>

<em>At that moment, she felt convulsions come from the hand she had just begun to hold, watching Riley get shocked with a renewed layer of “shock”on her face. That one was much stronger than before!</em>

“Guardian! Are you going to be oka-“

<em>Mid sentence, the same familiar wave of electricity coursed through her veins at the same intensity, with them both having been shocked in a very short span of time. The cries of Caramel once again filled the room, perhaps with a few noises from the farmer as well. They had been transported to hell. As she collapsed onto the blankets again, only managing the pain slightly better than last time, her cheek pressed against the tablet. After twenty minutes of being unresponsive, Caramel desperately crawled to her feet to rush towards the machine, this had to end! She stumbled against the wall and was struggling, but she beckons Riley to follow. Regardless of what happened, she could at least be there with her for moral support, if she so chose to come with her.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

“What brings you here?” He eyed them, looking at their ukulele, and then at the dark screen of their space helmet, hoping he was making … some sort of eye contact with them to be respectful when they spoke to him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Apollo tilted his head, still smiling.
“Pretty! I can play guitar, you know… I just don’t have one here! I don’t here ukuleles often, but they are pretty.” He nodded in approval.
“Great, i’d much rather be elated than depressed. What songs do you know? We’ll see if we have anything in common in our music tastes.” He was curious about what kind of music they liked.

Well! At least it makes you feel at home? Maybe?” He offers an awkward smile.
“Huzzah!” He echoes, letting out a laugh afterwards and smiling brightly at them. He seemed very nice, and was full of smiles and laughs. He hoped it made Uriel feel welcome, as since he was raised in the south, hospitality was his whole thing!

He lets out another loud laugh.
“Good one!”
Around Uriel, his voice had gotten louder too, to match theirs. I would hate it if anyone showed up to take a nap or something. These two are loud!
“I’m glad you’re prepared, I’m sure I’ll be fine!”

He then winced.
“Uhh, is there a problem..?”
Apollo seemed curious… did they not like the sound of a guitar? Did they not know what it was, and it upset them? Was the word offensive in Martian? Poor Apollo’s mind was racing wondering what might be wrong with that!
“Huzzah?” He chimed again, but with a slight inquisitive tone.

“Riiiight. Could you name a song, maybe? I can’t sing it if I don’t know it,” Apollo laughs a little, though his voice had— for now— gone back to normal. That probably wouldn’t last long.

“Right, or like a fierce tiger!” There it is! See? He’s loud again! And he also makes a sort of clawing motion and wrinkles his nose. He then laughs again, and goes quiet to wait for Uriel to name a song or two!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“No, I don’t think so.” He finally decided. “There are so many animals I like, I can’t choose one. I can tell you some I like, though.” He offered, before continuing on without waiting for an answer.

“Yeah, I guess there is a lot of good history… I like history.” He shrugged his shoulders a bit and nodded along as he spoke, tilting his head side to side as if he was considering it.

“I reckon!” He takes their hand and shook it firmly.
“Great! I look forward to it! I’ll hold you to it!”
And then he released their hand with a grin.

“What if it’s a situation like fish… like how one fish is ‘fish’ but a group of one kind of fish is also just ‘fish’, but a group of fishes with different species of fishes are called, well ‘fishes’…” A mouthful, wasn’t it? Apollo looks dizzy after saying that.

“Oh, cute. I like armadillos, but I usually see ‘em dead around the roads sadly… they ain’t the smartest. I like all them other animals too, so I’d probably like aardvarks.” He smiles. “But I like most animals so that’s unsurprising.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“No, it wasn’t. I wasn’t always alone, though. I had friends and strangers and lovers and people that were somewhere between.” Apollo laughed.

“It was kinda… how do I say… freeing? It sounds terrible, but it was my first time living on my own as a young adult.” He smiles softly, though he’s probably not going to become energetic again.

“Oh, uhm… That works, I guess.” He shrugs again, not feeling as motivated to talk as much as he had been.

“Well, do you wanna make some music or… another time, if you like..?” Apollo asked, seeming more shy now. He didn’t want to upset Uriel again, so he was being careful.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A beautiful sight indeed. 

They were quick to pocket the hairspray and lighter again, a smirk on their lips as they turned to look at the doc for a moment. 

What was better than committing arson with your siblings to celebrate a holiday? Nothing after all! 

“Remember pup, if anyone asks we saw nothing” they muttered though it likely wouldn’t be long till everyone knew they were the culprits, or well, they’d probably just assume she was. Pup was innocent in their eyes.

They were just pretty glad that hema was more than willing to keep silent about this, Arson would just be another notch on guide’s belt but As far as she knew hema’s record was clean. 

“What ya think the rest are gonna think when they see?” She asked looking down at Hema

They’d likely need to leave the scene of the crime soon, but well the fire was still just a nice respite from this hell and it felt bad to leave it

Sent by Spectator: &quot;Jack S. S.&quot;</strong>.

A large Apple shaped bomb, usually containing explosives, but it&#39;s seemingly empty.

&quot;Hello Riley!!

My name&#39;s Jack, I&#39;m a huge fan of you in the games so far! I really hope you survive, it&#39;d be awesome to taste some of your apples! Perhaps I can kidnap you and put you in my barn, you can farm for me!

But that aside, what&#39;d you think of the execution?!? I FOUND AMAZING!! My mom says I shouldn&#39;t watch this at my age, but I feel like it&#39;s fine?!? My mom killed my dad last week, he&#39;s still rotting on the bed... Perhaps you can plant him, make a tree out of him? At least that&#39;d make him useful for something!

If you do die, I hope you get executed. Perhaps a tree gets planted inside of you, or you&#39;re chased by flaming pitchforks and burned alive! I can&#39;t wait to see what brutal things they&#39;ll do to you!

Once I reach the legal age (I&#39;m currently 11~!) I&#39;ll join the gang and execute people just like they did with the gamer! I can&#39;t WAIT!!

But! I&#39;m here to send you a gift, it&#39;s a bomb my dad was working on! I painted it to look like an apple! It&#39;s like it&#39;s meant for you! I reeaalllyyy hope you like it! Perhaps find a way to fill it and BLOW SOMEONE UP!!! THAT&#39;D BE COOL!!!

But anyway, my mom is getting home soon, so I gotta get this sent!

Love, Jack.&quot;</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=1275324940500992000.html_Files/RileysAppleLarge-22D8D.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=1275324940500992000.html_Files/RileysAppleLarge-22D8D.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: RileysAppleLarge.png (16.86 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

Watching a murder happening right in front of her, seeing it rather than hearing it, only scarred the chocolate heart of hers that was only good for spreading joy and sweets to others.

She was squatting down next to the remains of their tent, looking right outside the border at a seemingly insignificant patch of dirt, the earth wet despite the absence of rain. There was a half-hearted attempt by the others to make their previously cozy living space somewhat more livable, a patchwork quilt of polyester and canvas of multiple shades of reds, purples, oranges, and browns forming a fluttering canopy of some kind. A disorienting combination for anyone. In one hand, she was in the photos app of her ePad, tapping on the screen and adding a glossy pink filter with flowers to a selfie from when she first got here. Caramel looked at her own brightness and naivety with envy, tilting her head so that her cheek was facing the bright blue sky. It was such a fond memory, setting up her first get-together here a few short weeks ago, posing to the camera with a peace sign.

She wouldn’t listen to that memory, it wasn’t true. Caramel just wanted to make others smile and cry when she needed to, what was so wrong with that? Why couldn’t that be enough?

As she turned around to see Riley, her expression maintained the natural positivity she carried deep within herself, despite the horrible circumstances she found herself in.

<em>Caramel wracked her brain for the limited information she has about this topic, kneeling down and watching the expert at work. She tried to find a correlation between the seed order, were the blueberries especially compatible with the strawberries? She shrugs at hearing about the job she was assigned.</em>

“As long as we can find a spade then I can do some serious digging. But no siblings huh? That’s too bad! I’m originally from Shinjuku so no crops in a big city, but as I’ve prolly mentioned, I work with farmers near the southern tip of Japan for cocoa, but unfortunately I’ve got to go all the way to Indonesia for my large scale projects! Who knows? If your crops are as high-quality as you say, mayyybe we can work together.”

<em>Caramel implied that they would both get out of there alive, making plans for the future. She was all hopeful and happy, but as she was asked to quite literally get her hands dirty, she visibly cringed, sucking her teeth in a little.</em>

“S-Sure… I can totally do that. Root around in the dirty dirt to plant angiosperms, can totally do that…”

<em>She wrapped a baseball cap that she had found in the gaccha around her hands to form a makeshift glove, taking the seeds and trying to plant them exactly as directed. If she was fruity, then she certainly didn’t fit the stereotype of the lesbian who wasn’t afraid to get her hands dirty!</em>

<em>With surprising strength, Caramel accidentally burrows too far into the dirt, her wrist fully submerged into the earth.

If she accepted the “truth” as presented, allowing her friends, allowing her precious cocoa cubs to blankly stare at the truth in front of them? Everything she fought for would be lost. 

Rousing to some form of consciousness from a combination of exhaustion and heavy disassociation, all she could hear was a high-pitched ringing noise, the thin threads of hope holding her together snapping in twain. To her left was a now worn and dirt-covered shovel, the debris on her hands and grime underneath his fingernails served as clear evidence that she had used it recently. In the ruins of the tent that once served as her home away from home, was a hole in the ground that was at least eight feet deep, and around five feet wide, most of the depth invisible as it continued on into the earth. The memory of her secret being announced mere moments ago had made her collapse to the ground, interrupting her project of creating a cozy den for them all to enjoy that she had poured days of effort into. Now that she had reawakened to fresh torment, she began to hyperventilate, clenching her fingernails into her palms until it began to hurt.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1313639360293503016 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1313639360293503016><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, 03 December 2024 22:53">22:53</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>The young lady sobbed with wild abandon, all pretense and class stripped away, the tears overwhelming her to the point it felt like she was drowning. Her piercing screeches of sorrow were only interrupted by deep inhalations, her body fighting to keep her conscious and alive, as her mind collapsed in on itself. After several minutes, her throat lost its ability to produce these sounds, whimpering like a starving stray dog and producing coarse tones she wasn’t able to before. Her sorrow was almost inhuman, every molecule that made up her body dissipating like it had never existed in the first place. Everything she had done, all that she had tried, all that she had worked for… it was gone.

A familiar red-hot feeling began to rise into her chest, the unpleasantly raw heat that she had resisted so fiercely. It was that same feeling those who couldn’t control themselves often felt, like every problem could be solved through venom. Unable to stop herself from embodying this feeling any longer, she stupidly pulled out her ePad, replying to messages unfettered by restraints. Every letter typed was like a chain embedded in her heart being yanked, pulled in two different directions. Spitting vitriol wasn’t the right thing to do but, on some level, there was a layer of satisfaction for standing up for herself, despite how harsh she was being. As she blew up a relationship she wanted to rekindle, she rolled over to her side and held onto her heart, trying to will it not to race so much as to cause it to stop entirely. Looking up from the dirt into the skin of her right wrist, the bold ink on her wrist of the number “52” stared back at her like the bottom of a bottle of scotch. She was sent back into a memory of a dimly lit room with multiple monitors, the professional looking room have a faint musty odor overpowered by a medicinal scent.

“I don’t WANT to Rina. I don’t want my friends to see me like this!”

The room fell in silence at the icy cold tone, the two looking down at the floor in silence. The one who shouted began to speak again.

“…I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to shout. All I can say is that this brings me joy, right now. To be Caramel Sweetney. It represents a lot more than being a personality that nobody has ever even watched before, there’s something more here. Like… she can save everybody, no matter how hard it gets. At least… that’s what I want it to be. Does that make sense?”

More silence, the sound of an air purifier in the background the only thing to break it. Finally, the other girl looks up and smiles at her.

“…I… think it’s amazing. That you’re amazing. Especially you putting yourself back out there after what happened before… you’re an inspiration. Though… why Caramel Sweetney? Didn’t think you were the dessert type like me? What, did you name it cause of MY interests? Oh sweet sister, how much you looooooove me~

One girl stuck her tongue out, teasing her and pulling one eye down with a finger. The other girl returned with a lopsided smile and a slap on the back, looking playfully combative.

“As I said before… shaddup. Let’s play a game, okay? I need a break from the screen, believe it or not! Let me just grab Uno or something.”

As this young girl went to the closet and started rooting around, the other girl remained at the computer waiting for her, drumming her fingers on the desk. It hadn’t seemed like anything special at first… but maybe? She began to form a hint of a smile as she gazed onto the avatar’s face. Her sister really was great at selling such a dream.</code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1313639809280901141 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1313639809280901141><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, 03 December 2024 22:55">22:55</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>The memory fading from her sight, the young woman came back to her agony, her body now seeming smaller as she shook and curled into a ball.

Caramel looked… pretty exhausted. She was still gloved, masked, and quiet, keeping her eyes mostly to the ground and attempting to not draw any attention. There was dirt all over her arms, hands, and legs; the efforts of her work not leaving her unscathed. Her hand wavered as she saw unclean skin, standing still for a few seconds before retrieving a water bottle from her bag, pouring a stream of water to cleanse herself. She wiped the debris off with a handkerchief, briefly glancing towards the direction of the camera, but unable to meets its lens with her eyes.

Caramel began to displace the earth from the dirt mountain into the surrounding farmland, trying to flatten out her surroundings as not to leave this big pile for everyone to see.

No roommates, no life… just her and empty beds.

She had travelled with a rucksack, to be precise it was Gaeuls rucksack. Hattori no longer wanted to leave it stranded in her dorm, it gave her protection - or that’s what it felt like to have it equipped. 

Upon returning to the dorm tents, the sound of grunts and huffs captured Hattori’s attention. She followed them like a whale communicating by echolocation to find a tired-out Caramel on her hands and knees in the dirt, digging.

“Caramel?”

She called out. A flicker of hope, a single wax candle in Hattori’s dim mind now alit. That’s what caramel did to her; light her candle; breathe her hope. It was a sigh of relief to come upon her once more, to see her.

“What are you doing down there?”

Hattori walked towards Caramel. through the ashen stained plain of where the old dorm tent used to sit.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was plain to see in the way she moved, the way she was slow to pivot to turn around. Whenever Caramel made a movement, there was flair, a style, a twist, a turn of the skirt and flutter of the jacket!

Just as she had begun to climb up, a certain individual came to the forefront, someone who made her feel a way that she didn’t know how exactly to describe. She made her way up, averting her eyes as her name was called out to her. As she cleaned herself off with water, she hazarded a few glances towards Hattori, looking a little… reserved, even as she was spoken to directly. She gave a little wave to her, kicking the dirt away and continuing to shovel. If she was the fire to her candle, then Hattori was the kerosene that helped her stay ablaze, so the fire would never be extinguished. But right now, with everything that had happened with the previous trial, it looked like the flame was flickering.</em>

“…I’m um… j-just making a little base down here. Thought it could make… a cozy den.”

<em>Without looking at her, she leaned down to the farmland that she and Riley had worked so hard on, seeing a few seedlings that have sprouted from the earth. It was amazing how, despite the excavation site being massive enough where dirt should have been at every corner of this place, not a single plant had been covered or tarnished in any way. Whether that meant anything, or was a coincidence, was anyone’s guess. With that mask, it was impossible to really tell.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hattori responded with a chirp in her voice, not exactly reading the room. Her joy in seeing Caramel was far too much which caused Hattori to stand gleefully awakened by her <em>sugary…</em> presence. The only change in tone that Hattori detected was Caramels switch in attire that happened before the trial. It was definetly <em>new.</em>

“I thought hummingbird’s belonged in trees. Not in burrows like a fox.”

Hattori teased Caramel, not knowing or being bothered by the fact it likely isn’t the time for such communication.

“You look- different, your outfit-,”

She stopped after that in case she would say something wrong. Hattori hadn’t yet had the chance to complement Caramels change in style. She didn’t know if it was permanent or not. In personal honesty she preferred the overly-sweet old caramel. But she liked this one just the same.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“S-Something like that. I guess I just… wanted… to have an area to crawl into that was small and protected. The sky… the rain, it can come down so hard sometimes…”

<em>Caramel stopped shoveling, her focus interrupted as that happy nervousness welled up within her at Hattori’s presence, the feeling sneaking past her gate of suppression. Why did Hattori have to look at her like that? It only made her circumstances more difficult, made her loving heart long to reciprocate her attention. Wanting to jump into her arms was a weakness when the last people who valued her attention had both turned into killers, one after another. She kept trying to look away without bringing her down, her eyes showing strife and nervousness. “Stop caring, please.

“It’s… a blessing that you’re alive and so loving… Pirate Lady.”

<em>Her weak will could only muster a portion of the truth of her feelings, not wanting to waste her time and energy over someone who couldn’t be the symbol she wanted to be, the one that she was at the start of the carnival. She rubbed her right wrist with her gloved fingers, revealing her four-fingered hands again.

She shuddered, each word coming out like a knife, piercing out of her chest like she was in pain. She shook as she successfully kept a lid on those really uncomfortable feelings she didn’t want to deal with, that being the only thing she could to not harm the one closest to her. Caramel hadn’t considered the hole in front of her like Hattori did, as a sign of giving up, and not being with her.

Nobody could set this tortured soul to rest so they could have a brighter tomorrow. Maybe it wasn’t even worth trying.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Was Hattori too far up in the clouds? They weren’t on the same page were they? Did Hattori get it all wrong? Her ears began to ring, due to thoughts now racing laps around her brain. Hattori’s eyes now frozen like a deer in headlights; she stared without a flicker of her eyelids. It was as if she were a printer lagging behind on its job - out of ink or paper, it made no difference. Hattori’s mind was in a state of limbo, she didn’t know whether to fight or take flight… if that applied here that is.</em>

<em>Caramel pulled in their hug, desperately reaching for kisses, but the effect it had last time was lost. Hattori kept hold of her, however she did not reciprocate the kisses. As she processed Caramel’s words Hattori finally opened her mouth.</em>

“I don’t know your Sister Caramel… I would love to but I don&#39;t-,”

<em>Hattori spoke monotonously before coughing, as if resetting herself for the conversation.</em>

“-And likewise, I would love to get to know you. The real you. You- you didn’t mean for her to get hurt, an- and you did what you thought was right, to carry on her internet persona. I don’t think you’re a bad person, I don’t think you’re selfish… I’ll be your friend and stick by you. I don’t want you to feel empty. I- I want you to feel happy, and return that brightness to you.”

<em>Hattori didn’t exactly know what she was saying, but it came from her heart and soul. She spoke earnestly, wanting to get through to Caramel. She buried her romantic feelings, which was assisted by the feeling of her candle being put out… Although it didn’t sting, it didn’t burn. It just wasn’t the time. It put a stone in her stomach that Hattori would ignore.</em>

“You can be yourself… You can heal…”

Meanwhile, Caramel had been dragged into the ground by chains of submission, pulled further and further into the ground until she couldn’t breathe anymore underneath the dirt.

Her sister was drifting further and further away from her mind, suddenly feeling cold and distant until she was spoke to again.

<em>Why was she talking about this? It’s all the same nonsense as before, with no solutions or happiness from her, and therefore, no value to anyone. Say something true and uncomfortable, even if it pushes her even further away!</em>

“…Truly, I get really frustrated inside, but I never let myself express my anger. Never once in the carnival would I say I even truly let it out, the most I did was send sassy and rude messages in our group chat. I don’t <em>want</em> to be that way.

Then why, when it came to this lady in front of her, why did she trust her so much? Trust that she would never betray her like the others, despite the fact that she had been close to Lucien and Fumi too?

“I want you to know that that is you I see when I imagine that. You are that person, Caramel.”

“G-goodbye.”

Imagining anyone else holding on to Hattori the way she did, laughing, and lighting the flame that she wanted to shelter from the blustery cold winds that froze them in place. The pitter-pattering of her heart turned into a thumping drumbeat, inversely correlated to how she breathed. That unmistakeable warmth climbed from her chest to her neck, and dyed her cheeks the color of alpenglow, the rosy light that remained just as the sun fell below the horizon. Having missed out on so many life experiences, Caramel really didn’t know how to define at all how she was feeling, her mind awash with all the times her special someone laughed, comforted, or even was just there with her. How was someone who lurked in her room all day looking at a screen, prohibited from exploring those deeper primal and romantic feelings, supposed to comprehend the depth of her own emotions?</em>

<em>…But it was fine never to know what this meant, right? If she truly wanted Hattori to be happy, then it was exactly as she said; the sword-smith deserved more than a hummingbird with a broken wing and disrupted song. She wouldn’t let herself look back, just like the story of Orpheus, everything would change if she peeked even for one single solitary second in time. Just as she resigned her dreams away, ready to push them down in the same way that she was just shown, the image of Kagi appeared in her mind’s eye, arms outstretched. Caramel watched her grin from ear to ear encouragingly, giving her a thumbs up and sticking out her tongue teasingly. Her sister was… just how she remembered.

M-Me? You want… <em>me</em>?”

<em>A hand went over her mouth as it gaped open in surprise, sounding incredulous at that affirmation. Her words finally connected to Caramel in a way that she could understand. Like tulips buds long closed due to the winter chill, she had long been held captive by the contractual requirements to not have a partner, the knowledge of a person like that coming to light surely tanking a portion of her viewership. Viewers that Kagi had earned, ones she had no right to sacrifice… But with the truth of her sister already revealed, and the bond between the two young ladies borne of a traumatic killing game growing stronger by the day, maybe something here made it all worth it. A deep passionate love that transcended just being a gal pal with her, something that she couldn’t find the label for.

As she drew closer and closer, an unexpected sight awaited Hattori. Regardless of the fact that she had previously covered her face and sealed off her heart, buried in her past and chained to her trauma, a glossy pink lipgloss was on her lips. Despite everything… maybe Caramel was still in there, just as bright and lovely as she always was. Maybe all it would take was someone who could listen to her when times got tough, let her express the good and the bad, and a patient listener who could help her unpack what was further within. But now… Hattori was the one that embodied suppression, hiding herself in a memento of the past to escape the present. Now that her own self-acceptance was welling up like a desert well, finally able to produce water that it hadn’t in generations, Caramel knew she couldn’t let Hattori shut down. A pleading voice filled with care, one reminiscent of their time under the information desk, called out to her.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1317966949896163440 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1317966949896163440><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, 15 December 2024 21:30">21:30</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Hey… darling, look at me, okay?

<em>As soon as she looked up, she would see the shaded glasses missing from Caramel’s face, revealing those caring and energetic eyes that only expressed compassion. Her heterochromia had given her a distinct look in life, especially with the dark circles from a lack of sleep these past few weeks outlining those brave eyes that she refused to conceal any longer. She removed the mask hanging from one of her ears and finally, summoning up the rest of her boldness, pulled off her gloves. The dessert nails had been fairly chipped by now, a distinct lack of a pinkie on each hand, a fitting reminder of the punishment for the secret that she had kept for so long. Caramel let her see all of the beauty and ugliness together, revealing the full ‘truth’ to Hattori. This was the ultimate sign of trust for her.</em>

<em>Caramel scootched back to her on the ground and cupped her cheeks like she was the most precious china that had ever been crafted, treating her with the care and sensitivity that she deserved. Now, pressed up so much against her, Hattori could surely feel her skyrocketing rapid heart-rate that refused to calm. She was as nervous as a girl who had just been invited to prom, not knowing if she was going to say ‘yes’ yet. Caramel didn’t even know how to do what she wanted to next, but she knew she had to try. She spun pure gold, the glimmer of the truth within her far more valuable than the most tempting of lies.</em>

“You could <em>never</em> be replaced. I only want you. Only you.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1317967052002299955 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1317967052002299955><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, 15 December 2024 21:30">21:30</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>Caramel‘s features were softened like she was amazed and dazed simultaneously, the pink color of her cheeks reddening and spreading further up towards her nose. It was like she was in a dream where the princess had stolen the breath from her very lungs, silencing all of her chatter and leaving her love-struck. She leaned forward with bated breath, moving purely on instinct rather than with any sort of plan or insight. She closed the distance between them entirely, locking her lips around Hattori’s and passionately kissing her with every bit of feeling that she ever had. There was a genuineness here, this act not one of running away from pain like her paltry replication of their special moment at the sleepover; It was an act of sincerity and love, casting aside the fear that had clipped her wings.

In this moment, her tentative nature had disappeared, the urgency of the kiss being all-consuming, all of her surroundings fading away to nothing. One hand moved away from her cheek towards the back of her head, her fingers weaving through her hair to pull her closest to her, making their ‘Five Minutes in Heaven’ last an eternity. The fireworks in her heart exploded in orange, white, purple, and pink colors as their life together in the future flashed before her eyes, imagining both of them far older holding hands and walking towards a cute suburban house, a few little ones running towards them. She finally drew away, a string of saliva that connected them lengthening and then breaking, with a dreamy, euphoric expression overpowering her.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1317967152405414010 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1317967152405414010><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, 15 December 2024 21:30">21:30</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>Before even a few seconds could pass, Caramel was overwhelmed with desire, hungering for just one more taste of everything that she had ever wanted. In an instant, with her arms supporting the small of her partner’s lower back, she carefully leaned her further and further back until Hattori was fully lying down. She soon followed it up with a tender and gentle smooch that made her heart soar into the clouds, finally joining Hattori above it all where they were both at peace, healing through hope. Her palms were planted in the ground on each side of her, feeling far more decisive when focusing on the person of her ultimate desire. She held each of her hands now, pressing their palms together and squeezing lovingly. As they finally finished swapping saliva, her eyes shone with the glimmer of ecstasy. 

Finally coming back to earth’s upper atmosphere, still enjoying this elation, but also being a bit more grounded in reality, Caramel began to stutter and look nervous through her flushed cheeks. How did she just do that? Why did she just do that?! She was so forward, assertive, and unable to suppress expressing just how much Hattori meant to her. It was like she could die for this lady, like she was family beyond family, imagining a diamond ring right on her finger, the same one she was currently clasping like there was no tomorrow. She looked quite embarrassed, looking off to the side, while still occasionally glancing towards her lips.</em>

“I’ve never felt this way before, and I’ve never done that <em>ever</em> with another person. I-I-I…! I love you so much that it hurts… I want to be with you, always. I’m so sorry… if that doesn’t make any sense at all. You make my head spin with everything that you say and do. You’re the one who completes me.”

Caramels&#39; hypnotising heterochromatic eyes reeled Hattori’s attention instantly. They were a pair of eyes worth seeing, a pair of eyes worth living for. Hattori had a smile that crept its way across her face making her lips a poignant landmark of her feelings. No longer buried in a rucksack, Hattori’s eyes met with the heavens - she was eye to eye with an angel.</em>

<em>What Hattori wasn’t expecting was Caramel&#39;s sudden forward movements. Hattori thought she had blown her chances, that their fate of rejection was sealed - not their lips. The softness of Caramel’s hands, like squishy marshmallows upon her face. Her skin was so fair, there wasn’t a single flaw Hattori could see. Everything was perfect. This moment was nothing but ethereal for the swordsmith, it was all she ever wanted. Her mind was carried away on a fluffy cloud with Caramel beside her, every direction was a beautiful scene with golden clouds hovering over reminiscent scenery of the rolling hills of her home.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1318011574849638480 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1318011574849638480><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, 16 December 2024 00:27">00:27</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>Hattori expected this to last only a second. A second of pure bliss that would cause her to crave more. However, unbeknown to her, Caramel had brung a whole platter of love. The deliciously decorated nails of the hummingbird tickled every fibre of Hattori’s face as they slithered their way to the back of her head. She tasted sweeter than Hattori had ever imagined. The popping citrus zing was more exhilarating than any lemon or orange she had. Strangely, Hattori’s nerves were controlled. They started off at fear-mongering heights and yet now they had mellowed into a place of zen. Like the icy lake surrounded by glacial mountains, not a ripple disturbed the crisp water.</em>

<em>Caramel pulled away to give the two a moment to breathe. However Hattori’s breath was already taken, and the only thing she could think of was taking Caramel’s back. Of course, the sweet being beat her to it. This time with more passion. The seductive thrust of Caramel’s face onto hers was the gift that kept giving. Hattori’s mouth was pent-up with saliva, it felt like it was boiling due to the warm blood in her cheeks. Like this kiss was raising her above the atmosphere into a remarkable plain of ecstasy never experienced before. Hattori’s eyes had fluttered shut once more, she imagined a golden field of reeds that her and caramel rolled in without a worry, clenching each other&#39;s bodies as closely as possible. This sensation became reality as Caramel cupped Hattori’s waist. Her body jolted only to instantly relax in Caramel’s grasp. She guided her to lay down, their mouths remaining locked.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1318011684467507222 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1318011684467507222><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, 16 December 2024 00:27">00:27</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>The negative weight on her shoulders had lifted and been replaced by the comforting weight of Caramel on top of her.

A brief moan of desire escaped her mouth, muffled by their makeout.</em>

<em>As Caramel eased off and sat back up, a burning passion tempted Hattori to snatch her right back down. Alas, Hattori prepped herself up with her arms, not wanting to get too ahead of herself. She focused on the sparkle within Caramel’s eyes as she serenaded her with only her voice. Everything about this girl was perfect… It was the same feeling as finding the perfect handle to its complementary blade. Hattori couldn’t stop her rosy smile for the life of her. She licked her saliva-rich lips to then wipe them with her sleeve. Hattori twirled her hair with a slight tilt in her head, admiring Caramel.</em>

“I love you,”

<em>Hattori couldn’t resist saying it again after hearing Caramel utter those three words. It meant everything to her, more than anything before. She had finally realised that there was more to life than her work, her smithery and her village. Was this what she had been searching for? When she ran away from everything as a maturing child, was this what she needed to find? Caramel breathed a new life within Hattori, like the coal to her fire in the workshop, the fan to her flame, the seed to her crop.</em>

“You’ve been the thing I have missed in my life. The hurdle that I could never pass. You have opened a door to everything I’ve been blind to before. You’re my key, Caramel.”

<em>She clasped her partners hands, (if that&#39;s what they were now) Hattori loved to do that, hold Caramel’s hands, feel her skin on hers. Hattori smiled with glossy eyes, now no longer lost in the fog that hid her life away.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

But, when she was looked at like such a worthwhile prize even in this damaged state, Caramel almost wanted to cry tears of divine joy. The value that was placed on her, the most beautiful woman in the world taking in her presence like how Prometheus gazed upon the first flame of creation to bring to humanity, a sign of change and hope, was such a meaningful feeling for her to have, considering what she wanted to do in life. They both had transcended beyond the physical, seeing beauty within each other that was spiritual in nature, with Caramel loving not just how dashing her partner looked, but the way in which she came to the clouds with her to see the world with her, watching how gorgeous their souls were when intertwined on a metaphysical level.

Caramel loved how there was still a distinctly feminine softness to her too, her frame still lean and supple in places like her stomach and chest, which made her heart flutter just like the butterflies in her own stomach. The way the bandana shifted as she drew her close, keeping only most of her hair within to maintain that tomboyish look, made her feel like she was reliable, stable, and that she could count on her for anything. But the strands and sections of her hair that fell out for Caramel to brush and hold onto… it satisfied her need for play, representing that she could always count on her partner to let loose with her, unabashed by the standards of society that had so frequently held her down. Her fingers were calloused and strengthened from her time mastering metallurgy through sword-crafting, each unpainted finger nail representing a blank canvas for Caramel to project her love onto, already imagining their hands intertwined as she painted it with pirate-themed symbols and paraphernalia. Her expression became even dreamier, mouth slightly open as she pulled away, looking directly at the hand that would one day have a ring with a luster worthy of its bearer’s finger.

She had never gone beyond smooching someone on the cheek like a chaste middle schooler, but now with this angel in her embrace, she felt the devil’s temptation to go above and beyond to give her everything she wanted and more. Their position was unbreakable, with Caramel being surprisingly far heavier than expected, like the weighted blanket Hattori may have expected to feel had just been to a Thanksgiving Feast buffet and gained tens of pounds. 

As she became one with her once more with a kiss, she tasted this refreshing taste of honey that she couldn’t get enough of, this understated yet profound sweetness that warmed her like she was swimming though a honeycomb. The sugary-sweet feeling coursing through her body, causing her back to arch in pure satisfaction, was almost medicinal, like every touch of hers healed her broken childhood, the memories of neglect that haunted her on a deeper level beginning to make her feel less lonely. As Hattori moaned through the kiss, Caramel blushed even more than she thought possible, her face more similar to a bright-red tomato in the summer than anything. A piping hot brew of liquid caramel and chocolate couldn’t compare to this kind of heat awakened in her from that, having all the intensity of bloodlust, but all being directed towards satisfying both of them no matter what.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1318701003423612968 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1318701003423612968><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, 17 December 2024 22:06">22:06</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>She knew it in this moment, this was the most delicious flavor she had ever experienced, a brief flash of thousands of desserts from German Chocolate Cakes topped with coconut shavings and frosted with buttercream, to airy textured souffl&#233;s with chocolate sauce and whipped cream, coming out of her workshop with this taste.

It had taken all of her willpower to not go in for round three, opting to take a few mental snapshots of this scene in her head. She looked down at the ground, looking exceedingly embarrassed at what had just occurred, and the dominant role she had played in their passionate display. Despite the self-consciousness, her voice sounded so smooth and had such a merry undertone; it was like they were back to their first meeting.

It was a title that she knew she had to embody for the rest of her life. “Kagi couldn’t pursue her dream to the end because of me, so I must inherit her desires. I need to grow her audience, reach the world, let the name Caramel Sweetney be known around the world!” Even when she made great strides, in her mind, credit was always given to the one who had started it all.

Hattori hadn’t even known of her talents before she came here… it was</em> <strong>this</strong> <em>Caramel Sweetney’s force of personality that had attracted her. As she spoke about Caramel, about being that missing element in Hattori’s life that had now come home to put her existence back together, it almost made her want to cry tears of joy, to fold herself like an omelette into her arms and thank her a thousand times over for breathing life back into her. The same bubbliness that she thought she had lost forever. Despite not even realizing it, these tears of pure gratitude and joy fell from her face as she laughed in relief, not even bothering to wipe anything away. She was the very picture, no, she was far beyond how she had been at the start. Her wide smile was infectious.</em>

“How did it take this long to find you? I feel like I haven’t really taken air in through my lungs, food through my mouth, or even taken my first steps properly without you in my life. All of it is better with you here. You… came along during my darkest time to bring me back… and I came during yours to fill in the gaps that maybe you never wanted to look towards.

The electricity in the air from the sleepover had evolved with a power surge between them, and the one thought at the forefront of Caramel’s head was if lightning could strike twice. Or thrice… that would be fantastic too. Her eyes flickered westward, the half-covered entrance to the den a potential invitation. She had truly done a massive amount of work on the interior, making a homely spot away from home. There was a silent temptation to engage in lechery where truly, no one would be able to see them except for god themselves. More cuddling and kisses than she could ever imagine… but she didn’t how ready she was for anything further. She bit her lip at the blank canvas that was her girlfriend’s neck, unmarred by her kisses as of yet, feeling a nagging desire to correct that mistake. She didn’t say anything, reengaging with reality over fantasy as she squeezed her hand in a caring fashion with her undivided attention. Caramel had never been so relaxed. She discussed a more innocent subject, the aggressive wolf taking a little nap for the moment.</em>

“You know… I would love to paint your nails, if you wouldn’t mind. You have such slender fingers and they would look quite nice in some shade of crimson or ruby. Ooh, and there definitely needs to be a flag design!”

<em>It was up to Hattori how she responded to this, and where things went from here. Regardless, today broke the record for Caramel’s happiest day ever, despite the murder circus.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

That was the exact query zooming through Hattori’s head. Luckily, Caramel made this easier with her sweet lulls of expressions. If she were the stars then she was the brightest, most intricate constellation in the galactic sky. Hattori was fond of the moon. From the many nights crafting a sword under the light of the full moon - a common tradition to bless the weapon - To the guided paths she traversed on her lonesome with the stars as her guide. Now there was a third memory she correlated with the spectacular night - her moments with Caramel.</em>

“You’re more than just my number one hummingbird~,”

<em>Hattori caressed Caramel’s cheek, tucking some hair behind her ear at the same time.</em>

“You’re the thing I relish most in this world. More than any metal, any wood, any mould. I think what we are is something powerful, meaningful. I’m not sure what our title is but… it’s everything to me. ”

Staring at Caramel’s face was an activity Hattori would excel in.

Hattori’s eyes were drawn to her lips, feeling her gaze fall at times. At once it fell farther, lower… The way Caramel’s thighs sat together like cushioning pillows. Two freshly baked goods straight out of the oven… Hattori never knew she had a sweet tooth for Caramel; and no, it&#39;s not the chocolate type.</em>

<em>Hattori Looked down at her nails, they were less chipped as usual due to her not being in her shop doing her craft. Though there were signs of them being picked at and scratched from things such as fidgeting, anxiety and stress. You would think Hattori would have the typical, brawly, meaty hands you would assume a blacksmith to have. However, Hattori’s hands were thin and slender, her fingers - delicate.

<em>Obviously, painting her nails in her line of work would be pointless! Even when wearing gloves they would get worn down and scratched away sooner than later. The idea of painting nails brought Hattori’s mind to her own sister, Dawn. Hattori always saw Dawn loading her face with makeup and rummaging around with what leather jacket and spiked boots to wear on an outing, and at the same time; painting her nails. Of course, mentioning anything about a sister right now likely wouldn’t be the right move…</em>

“Alright, I’d love you to do that, perhaps another time, but soon. It’ll be so much fun!”

<em>Hattori’s face was flushed once more due to the charm of Caramel. Hattori’s favourite colour was a deep red, she was flattered to hear Caramel mention it! Crimson, ruby or cherry you name it! That was Hattori’s colour.</em>

“I enjoy our times together. When I’m by your side it’s like everything is normal again. I- I always want to be with you. Don’t go like the rest.”

<em>She looked at her with wide-eyes, searching for assurance within Caramel - hattori’s fruitful half.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A playfulness awakening within her and her left hand free from the handholding gave her a beautiful idea, pulling out a familiar marker and steadily drawing a little doodle on her cheek. Both of their smiles were worth a thousand volts as she drew a particularly plucky daisy that never seemed to quit, imagining inviting her to the Kyoto Botanical Garden overlooking the conservatory that meant so much to her. Her thumb traced over the drawing on her face like she was painting, trying to overwrite her prior connection to the building where she was born and the flowers in the garden that surrounded it, attempting to erase their association with her father in favor of these new blossoming feelings.
