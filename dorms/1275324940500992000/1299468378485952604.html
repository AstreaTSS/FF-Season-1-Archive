Despite her attempts to liven up the atmosphere, it always seemed that she had her most emotional moments in this very room. She couldn’t keep a handle on herself like everybody else, her mind flashing back to the image of a hard-working PYTHIA finding the clues to the corpse without hesitation. What was going to happen now? The pain of the electric shocks would have almost been a comfort, a way for her pretend like nothing so tragic had occurred on her watch.

She paced back and forth between the entrance of the tent and the exit, a nervous expression on her face. She seemed very jumpy, unable to stop herself from moving. Seeing the cheesy little sign she had set up for her party of “keep your hands clean”, with a drawing of a Labrador covered in cake, Caramel stared at it while tightly gripping her own arm. She reached down and threw one of the boxes far into the distance, storming off into the tent for the final time and trying to keep herself in check. 

As she laid down onto her spot, she noticed a small gift-wrapped box underneath the pillow that she always used with it being labeled: “For Caramel Sweetsy”. Silently, she began to unwrap it.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

I love watching you bubbly types in situations like this! It&#39;s so fun to see you try to keep composure, it&#39;s like watching bugs(affectionate, by the way)! Don&#39;t take this the wrong way though, i AM rooting for you, you can consider me as your #1 supporter here, feel free to use me as a stepping stone if you feel like!

The bad news was that Lucien was left with a horrible burn wound all around his neck. The relief of being free only lasted a few seconds before blood began oozing down the grave keepers neck. Not only that but the wound was starting to look a bit infected... Lucien carefully poked the wound and winced. Yep. That wasn&#39;t good at all. If he didn&#39;t get help immediately, then there might be another BDA announcement.

Lucien didn&#39;t actually investigate or even see the body. The moment someone was announced dead he went to make sure anyone he cared about was alive. He only stayed in the distance, watching everyone from afar. He didn&#39;t dare get close to the body. Lucien couldn&#39;t handle seeing someone killed.

Now the grave keeper wandered into tent four. He had a hard time tending to his wound, so he went to search for his good friend Kinto! Like him, Kinto had bandages, so he must&#39;ve known a thing or two about tending to wounds. And if not, Lucien would teach him. 

&quot;Kinto? Are you in here?&quot;

Sadly, Kinto was not here. But instead Lucien stumbled upon the dog girl! He recognized her as the cheerful and bubbly girl from the motivation announcement. Yet right now... She didn&#39;t seem like herself.

&quot;O-Oh... S-Sorry miss... I was just looking for my friend....&quot;

Lucien noticed the box of chocolates. Oh dear, was she also a victim of the horrendous gifts? The grave keeper walked up to her to get a better look at the chocolates. He never really had any sweets before... So this really got him interested. 

&quot;Oh! D-Did you also get a gift from the outside? I didn&#39;t know w-we could get gifts... That was until someone... Gave me a shovel....&quot;

Just thinking about the &quot;gift&quot; made Lucien shudder.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She held one of the chocolate hearts aloft in her hands, taking a small nibble on one of the delicacies to compare it to her own process, throwing caution to the wind given that her manager wasn’t able to check it for her. Although the wording came off as a little odd in places, it managed to lift her spirits ever so slightly. She couldn’t help but laugh at the second to last line, a short and pained one, as the letter reminded her of Fan-Mail Mondays, where she received letters and hand-crafted gifts from viewers inspired by what she did. Though this was about the 798th time someone asked her to use them as a stepping stone, bunch of weirdos…

She snapped back to reality (ope there goes gravity) as she heard an unfamiliar voice call out to her, her disassociation turning to fear as she heard a new threat potentially enter the tent. The appearance of an honest to goodness corpse had turned her bubbly energy into skittishness it would seem. She immediately covered herself with the blanket quite obviously, peeking out from underneath to see Lucien begin calling out to another unknown individual. Caramel, wiping the obvious tears from her eyes from before, slowly revealed herself as he spoke to her, smiling bashfully with stained red cheeks.</em>

The grave keeper stepped a bit closer to the girl and twirled his hair a bit.

&quot;It&#39;s just my natural hair but... I&#39;m assuming t-those are complements... So t-thanks!&quot;

Lucien nervously rubbed the back of his head as Caramel talked about her cocoa cubs. Is that a type of bear? The grave keeper had no idea you could raise bears as pets! Lucien imagined cocoa as a strong and fierce warrior who led an army of cocoa bears... It was an outlandish thought but Lucien&#39;s naive nature led him to believe it. Then the topic of sweets was brought up. The grave keeper looked down at the floor and nervously fidgeted with his bandages. He didn&#39;t know any sweets off the top of his head, he never even had anything like that before.  But if Caramel really gave them out, perhaps he could try one? Yet the boy was too shy to ask.

&quot;I-I&#39;ve never really had any sweets before.... But hearing people talk about them really makes me curious... I guess they must be amazing! People s-seem so happy when eating them....&quot;

Lucien smiled at the thought of other people&#39;s happiness. The joy of having a sweet must be a great experience. One that Lucien never had. The grave keeper took in her appearance. And oddly enough, he thought of her as a bear! Brown hair? Definitely a bear woman. 

&quot;I&#39;m Lucien Moreau! I-Im actually the ultimate grave keeper. N-Not a dwarf but I do like digging holes! That&#39;s why they gave me a shovel I suppose...&quot;

This was definitely nothing like the girl he saw at the motivation meeting. The sight of a body clearly horrified the girl. Lucien however remained calm. The only thing that bothered him was the fact someone here actually murdered another person. The grave keeper walked over to the girl and sat down next to her.

Such a bright and beautiful sight to see someone glow with positivity. The grave keeper couldn&#39;t help but smile. Not only did she make chocolates but she also donates to charity? How thoughtful! The grave keeper smiled and tilted his head as he listened to her ramble on. Then... She suddenly went back to being gloomy again. Wait minute... Those are dog ears? Was she a dog woman this whole time?

&quot;N-Never had a sweet in my life. I was told it was bad for my health... Especially since I had extremely bad health as a child. B-But I&#39;m sure eating one won&#39;t kill me!&quot;

Lucien nervously fidgeted with the bandage on his arm again. He was really tempted to eat one of her sweets... They looked so good...

&quot;Huh? Nicknames? ....I&#39;ll call you... Hm.... Choco bear! Because you have an army of bears!&quot;

&quot;Oh... Y-Yeah I&#39;ve seen plenty of corpses in my life. I&#39;ve gotten so used to being near them... But it still does make me fear what happens after we die. Where do we go? Will we see our loved ones again? Just the thought of it makes me worry. Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;ve fought to survive for so long.&quot;

Lucien looked over at Caramel only to see her shudder and grasp her arms. The poor thing was so scared.. The grave keeper looked at her with sympathy. He knew what it felt like to be trapped and scared... Lucien scooted a bit away to give her space. People need room to breathe and let their emotions out.

&quot;Well... I live in the graveyard.... I-It&#39;s the only home I&#39;ve ever known. And so I dedicated myself to keeping it clean and beautiful. Graveyards are places of memories.... And seeing one be well kept warms my heart knowing that people cherish and respect those who have passed on...&quot;

The grave keeper looked at the three boxes and let out a soft hum. Which one should he take? Well the grave keeper quickly made his decision and took the one wrapped in red. He didn&#39;t want to annoy Caramel by taking too long.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

However, he relaxed upon seeing that it was just a kind gesture. Physical contact always made him nervous and flustered. But right now, he felt calm and accepted. Seeing caramel smile made himself smile. She was trying her best to break out of the gloom, and Lucien admired that. For a bear dog warrior, she was clearly the strongest. However his smile suddenly faded when the word &quot;Mother&quot; was spoken. Lucien looked down and nervously fidgeted with his bandages.

&quot;M-My mother.... Right.... I guess....&quot;

The grave keeper shook his head and looked back at Caramel. He couldn&#39;t let a sour mood ruin this sweet moment. 

&quot;It really d-depends on who has died really.... If it&#39;s an old person... I find myself happy that they lived a long life. They had time to experience all kinds of emotions, and now they have peace. But when it comes to babies and children.... I-I bawl my eyes out for hours. They didn&#39;t get to experience the joys of life.... I&#39;ve never met another grave keeper. It&#39;s just me running the graveyard. It actually became a tourist spot thanks to my hard work.... Strange right?&quot;

Lucien let out a soft chuckle upon remembering his achievement. The once abandoned graveyard became a beautiful place of memory because of his efforts. When he scooted away, Caramel tightened her grip on him. The grave keeper winced a bit, but understood the message. She really needed a friend right now. And so Lucien scooted closer to her and gave her a friendly smile.

&quot;Well I did have... A place to live before the graveyard. B-But after.... Well I just started to live there alone. G-Graveyards are places of beauty and memory and should be treated with respect.&quot;

The grave keeper began to unwrap the box in his hand. He tilted his head at the sight of the fudge. He&#39;d never seen anything like it before. Lucien picked up the fudge and hesitantly took a bite. Instantly, his face seemed to light up with joy.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Or father! Or extended family member you love, or close friend, doesn’t have to be her! Hahahaha, um anyways, if you don’t mind me asking, are you injured? You’ve been messing with those bandages, and I hope um, maybe we can find you a medkit or smth. Unfortunately, the only ‘Band Aid’ I have is of the gummy variety!”

<em>That nervous laughter when she knew she messed up but didn’t know how to save it. Whew, she had totally resolved the awkwardness of the situation! Caramel listened to his perspective, flinching slightly as he went to talk about younger people who met the reaper far too early. She began to rub her thumb in a circular motion on her palm, squeezing his shoulder as he spoke of such things as if to squeeze physical comfort into him. Her eyes were downcast.</em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, 27 October 2024 01:07">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1299902128839462933 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1299902128839462933><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, 27 October 2024 01:06">01:06</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Kids are often so bright and shine like no other group of people! Overtime, they get kinda shoved into roles they don’t like and are forced to lose themselves. I wish they d-didn’t die of course, but I’m happy that they passed on with that light. T-To be honest, that is a little strange, but I kinda like it! You’ve transformationalization’d it (totally a word Caramel) into a place of reflection and love rather than misery! Kinda like those kids are a symbol of more even when they’re gone of that sunshine we adults often miss.”

<em>She placed a level of importance on that last part, sounding a little angsty about it almost. At the very least, her mind was off of Khuong for the moment. A graveyard man to distract her from a corpse, how ironic! After she grasped, apologized, and yet Lucien still moved in closer, Caramel would hide a thousand-watt smile behind her other hand. No she wasn’t happy! That was just a weird twitch on her face.</em>

“Oooooh I see, I was gonna say that if you started off in one you’d be like Marik from Yu-Gi-Oh, like, living in a tomb and guarding it underground! Sorry uh, you probably get confused with all my <s>nonsens</s> interesting references! I’m kinda chronically online and a bit of a um, shut-in, unless it’s for work hehe. Maybe I said that already.”

<em>As if on cue when speaking about her work, Caramel looked at Shovel Knight eagerly to see his reaction to the treats she had quite literally spent an entire day on. This was a tiny sample that was supposed to tide them over until her truck arrived, but alas, it looked like this was what she could provide for now. As he enjoyed it, she beamed, her ears (both sets!) perking up.</em>

Friends. Lucien never had any of those. Anyone he had ever loved abandoned him. Those traitors. Lucien&#39;s nails dug into his legs as the faces of those who wronged him lingered in his mind. Thankfully, Caramel changed the subject quite quickly. Lucien let out a soft breath and grinned at caramel.

&quot;O-Oh not really... Uhm... I&#39;m not really sure how to explain it.... But I have some scars I&#39;m insecure about.... It makes me feel better hiding them....&quot;

Lucien looked back at Caramel. The way she seemed to flinch when he talked about kids dying oddly reassured him. She clearly had a kind heart, and that&#39;s something Lucien can admire. <em>&quot;They get kinda shoved into roles they don&#39;t like and are forced to lose themselves.&quot;</em> Those words hit close to home. The grave keeper knew the feeling all too well. Freedom was something you had to fight for. Something you had to break the rules for. 

&quot;Yeah... I believe that everyone goes to a better place when they die.... Unless they were a bad person.... &quot;

Lucien looked down at his hands. Everyone goes to heaven right? He&#39;s lived a life free of sin. Surely he&#39;ll go to heaven too right? Is this why he&#39;s been fighting for so long? The grave keeper snapped out of his trance and looked back at Caramel with a smile. Silly him. Getting all mopey again.

&quot;I really don&#39;t mind the nonsense. Even if I don&#39;t understand it, it&#39;s still nice to learn about!&quot;

Lucien took another bite of the fudge as he spoke. The flavor was nothing like how he expected it to be. At first he was a bit scared that eating something like this would kill him instantly, but surprisingly, it didn&#39;t! It just tasted amazing. 

&quot;Y-Yeah!! I love life!! Miss Caramel&#39;s sweets are the best!! And I&#39;m gonna live so I can have more sweets!!&quot;

Even when Lucien tried to raise his voice, it still came out pretty quiet. But he was just trying his best. Caramel&#39;s sunshine and rainbows was definitely contagious, because now Lucien was all giddy and bubbly. Quite unusual.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>She made a little heart symbol with her hands, maybe that was enough to distract him from his clear pain?

A vision of an empty classroom with papers scattered across the floor played throughout her mind, a green eraser broken in two laying on the teacher’s desk.</em>

“Exactly! See there are a ton of haters I have that just get confused and don’t try to get me! And hey, maybe that’s the case for you too, I’m sure people have misunderstood you as well! The important thing is to live every day like it’s the best one ever. I just don’t ever want to see someone leaving their love and desires and goals and hopes half-finished.”

<em>Nothing made her happier than someone enjoying her fudge, her work was more than just making desserts. It was about innovation, and transporting her customers to a world of sugary goodness that they never wanted to leave. She was delightfully surprised by her enthused reaction, having not gotten such a strong reaction from anyone at the carnival yet. She slapped her hands together and turned her body to the side, doing a little side spin in joy.</em>

“HELLLLLLLLLL YEAAAAAA! INDUCTION OF A NEW FELLOW COCOOOOOOOOA CUB! Okay soooooooo when we get out of here, you gotta subscribe! I run so many fun events and get to travel all around for work, it’s not just chocolate, I made a heist factory, an obstacle course, and so much more all themed around edible arrangements!”

They had been there for so long, he can&#39;t even remember the last time he&#39;s seen that scar. Maybe it would be best if it got some fresh air. Though... He wanted to keep it hidden longer. Some things are meant to be hidden.

&quot;W-Well.... You are interesting! I&#39;ve never really met anyone like you... You have so much energy a-and you&#39;re very kind... So I can see why people take an interest in you!&quot;

Lucien grinned. Seems like Caramels words and attempts at comfort worked well. The grave keeper hated the fact he kept bringing the mood of the conversation down.

&quot;Ah right right... I&#39;ve never been to any of those before.... Hm...&quot;

Lucien seemed a bit startled when she placed both hands on him. Woah now this was getting intense. Lucien never really got this much physical attention before, and it was causing him to heat up a bit. Though he was a bit uncomfortable, it oddly made him feel better. Caramel shouldn&#39;t have to be in a situation like this. Someone this kind doesn&#39;t belong in this harsh reality. Lucien felt the need to protect her in a way, to shield her eyes when things got too violent. If only someone had done the same for him. Maybe then he wouldn&#39;t have grown up so hurt.

&quot;Love, desires, goals, hopes.... I see...&quot;

What a pity. Lucien&#39;s only reason for going on in life was survival. He can&#39;t handle love, his only desire is to live, he has no goals, and he&#39;s lost all hope a long time ago. Or has he? He did hope to escape this game with everyone. And yet his false reality of happiness was shattered the moment someone was killed. His only plan now was to survive and escape. 

&quot;Y-Yeah! I&#39;m a cocoa cub and I&#39;m proud!&quot;

Lucien had no idea what that meant. But hey, he&#39;s just happy to be included.

&quot;Those events sound so fun! I promise to go to each and every one of them! And I&#39;ll eat so many of your sweets! A-And I&#39;ll subscribe! I don&#39;t really know what that means but I&#39;ll do it!&quot;

How joyous.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
