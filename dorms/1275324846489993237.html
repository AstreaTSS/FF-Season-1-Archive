There was so many multi-colored blankets and pillows scattered around a corner of the room, that is resembled the old dorm four’s snug vibe. Dim makeshift string lights filled the room with soft light, the color shifting in a rainbow pattern very slowly. There was a table covered with a tablecloth (that might have just been a thin blanket) in the right corner, bottles of wine, vodka, and other forms of liquor freshly polished and displayed like art. Multiple cups were stacked next to it, with about twenty small ones about the size of shot glasses already filled in front.

Furthermore, there were mashed up together game boards to the left side, around ten neko coins laying right in front for some reason. It looked rather makeshift, but it was what she could find and it still looked interesting at the very least. Finally, there was an area in the far back of the tent surrounded by blankets that formed a curtain around a private 5 foot by 5 foot section. It was like a small room within the tent, with a sign on it that said “5 minutes in heaven”.

Meanwhile, Caramel was off to the side by the final area, a super tiny area with a few bottles of nail polish, actively finishing the final strokes of a clear top coat over her intricately painted nails. As she was finishing, she waved with a bright smile on her face at the people who entered, looking excited!</em>

&quot;Hi everyone! Gosh, you all look amazing. Everyone, remember to thank Caramel. She&#39;s amazing. I couldn&#39;t host all these things without her.&quot;

Yuri had her hair fully down, with a lack of goggles. She&#39;d removed her hoodie and gloves, though kept her tank top, and replaced her shorts and tights with some baggy pj bottoms and fluffy socks from her luggage.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>The sounds of trudging feet approached the tent. Fumi wasn&#39;t sure how late it was, only the sun was long gone. She wasn&#39;t sure how she would explain what happened, but maybe if she snuck in no one would ask. Her hand slipped through the tent flap, gently lifting it up. When she looked in, all she could see were the other girls fast asleep. That was except Caramel.

As expected, Fumi was one of the only ones standing.</em>

<em>She was sure to be quiet as she went off to her own corner of the tent. Her head rested on the cold, hard ground. The energy needed to get a pillow wasn&#39;t there. Instead, all she could do was lie motionless on the floor, staring straight up at the ceiling. The scene felt all too familiar. Her average &quot;crash&quot; after a long day, where nothing but her thoughts could disturb her. ...Maybe that&#39;s why it was so hard to fall asleep. At the end of the day, that&#39;s when her actions would come back to haunt her.</em>

<em>When she should be sleeping, she would find herself replaying a scene in her mind. Every ounce of regret comes to the surface in one moment to keep her awake. Should She imagine comforting memories to fight it? Maybe if she drank enough she would eventually pass out. Fumi was taking neither option, rather keeping her eyes locked with the ceiling until her mind finally had mercy on her. She did warn the others that she could pull an all nighter with ease. There was no rest to be found for her.</em>

She smiled and placed a hand on her heart after recollecting her time off with Jax. Whilst, obviously, the panic and the danger was scary, the heartwarming moments made up for it.

&quot;I&#39;m too old for this, anyways. Besides, I had a nice time helping Jax.&quot;

Her face was a mess, foundation uneven and runny, mascara running down her face, and the mustache that Yuri had drawn on her face earlier mostly erased. She kept muttering to herself, trying to redraw the same lines upon her lips that served as a memory of her friend.</em>

“No… Why did you… how could this… this… I t-thought…”

“Why can’t… why can’t I do it like s-she did… Yuri… Yuriiiiiiii…”

<em>She stretched the syllable, saying it ever so quietly and with anguish empowering her tone. Why wasn’t she over this? Felix, Gaeul, and everyone else, they were all gone.

Her skin was as soft as always, it reminded Hattori of when caramel marked her with three hearts on either side of her face. The delicacy, the control, the message. Caramel was a good person, and all that they say is true. But Hattori hated to see Caramel build so much pressure upon herself.</em>

“You have all the Value in the world, Caramel.”
Her eyes wide and with thought, Hattori was genuine. Seeing the reflection of herself within Caramels deep glossy eyes was a wake up call.  She studied herself by the use of intent eye contact. Hattori looked worse for wear; paler than usual, skinnier in the face, her hair all unkempt. And yet, Hattori couldn’t help but wonder, is that what Caramel saw? What did she see in front of her? <strong>Who</strong> did she see?*

“And- you’re not alone… it’s not up to you, it’s- it’s up to all of us, to band together and - and to rid this evil.”

<em>Hattori’s sight was locked on the face of Caramel, she knew what she saw. A powerful, cheerful, and brave woman. A courageous, empathetic, and optimistic person. A friendly, loving, and… everything.</em>
She was Everything.

“Smile, for yourself Caramel… things are different, constantly changing but, no matter how many of us go, we will keep pushing…”

<em>Deep breathes Hattori.</em>

“-for Yuri,”
<em>fuck that hurt.</em>

“For Gaeul,”
<em>I won’t ever forget the smile she gave me.</em>

“And for all of them.”</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=rainbow_flag><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=🏳️‍🌈 src=1275324846489993237.html_Files/1f3f3-fe0f-200d-1f308-F64A2.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>4</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

She looked ever so tired without her makeup on, her watery eyes producing only but a few tears after adapting to so much trauma. Her expression was melancholic and vulnerable, but with the tiniest flickers of courage from before, like a knight who had been defeated in battle. The makeup wipe had traded some of her beauty for clean skin free of impurities like residual oil, her round cheeks even squishier and smoother than they ever were. Her eyes were expressive today, searching deep and deeper still into Hattori’s eyes, trying to dive into her soul to understand why she could be so thoughtful and loving to someone like her. Many had tried to catch the attention of the V-Tuber star that always made her fans laugh, but few would get to see her like this.

Upon hearing those meaningful words, Caramel’s reaction was twofold: An unexpected side of hers came out, her eyes widening in confusion and disbelief, as if her comment was unwelcome. But there was also something else, her features now relaxing as she caught a glimpse of the complete sincerity that was that look in her eye. The ever so lovely Hattori, stunning her with her acceptance, and a reciprocity in emotions that made her feel like she could trust her with anything. It wasn’t a pale unkempt girl that she saw, it was the brave and courageous pirate lady who dared to reach out to someone who insisted she deal with everything herself. Someone she never</em> <strong>needed</strong> <em>to worry about, but who did so anyways.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1307562480624472064 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1307562480624472064><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, 17 November 2024 04:26">04:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“I… I c-can’t give up my responsibility. I want e-everyone to be okay, this is who I am… but…”

<em>Despite everything, her face became flushed, her cheeks becoming more rosy as her temperature increased. She looked at Hattori in awe, respect, and also… with great affection. When she had first reached out her hand to the lady underneath the desk, it was only to help someone in need. To continue to shoulder a great weight of responsibility within her that had no discernible cause as to why she had to be the one to hold it. But now, looking upon the pirate lady who told her to smile not for others but for herself, showing her that she was more than what her peers thought of her, and most of all, that a special woman like herself would band together with her along the way? Caramel wanted Hattori not out of a sense of duty, but because she was Hattori. A kind-hearted, wonderful woman whose first instinct upon meeting her was to protect her, and the one that Caramel wanted to cherish forever.

Caramel smiles ever so warmly now, for herself, for Hattori… and, as their names were said, for Yuri, Gaeul, and all who had fallen. Bittersweet tears that originated from a mix of happiness and sadness fell down her face without restraint. She moved her own hands up to Hattori’s cheeks, cupping them in the same affectionate way, but also pressing their foreheads together once more. As she brushed her fingers over her face, maybe she could feel the hearts she once drew. Thinking of that memory fondly, Caramel came to a conclusion. This was the only place she wanted to be right now.</em>

“Even in the moments you don’t smile, Caramel-,”
<em>She let out a slight chuckle, baffled of what she was about to say.</em>
“You’re still the sweetest, p-prettiest and earnest person that you are.”

<em>It was after saying that, it clicked in Hattori’s mind: Caramel was the answer, Caramel was the motivation that Hattori had been searching for. All throughout her life, her journey, her work. Hattori had supporters but, she was always alone. The years she spent in solitude from when she ran away was the mould that made her who she is. But Caramel - Caramel was the molten metal, the blood of her blade, the wrapping of her hilt, the wielder of her happiness…

“You’re the light in the fire I see every time I would make a sword…”

*She now spoke aloud, for she wanted Caramel to hear her realisation.</em>

“You’re the smiling sunrise I would wake up early to see every day. Caramel, you’re the song of the hummingbird, the one that changes my tune.”

<em>She looked at her with admiration. For Caramel to show this side of herself, it wasn’t weakness, it was bravery!

As someone with zero experience with relationships, for the one who had revolved their life around inside jokes and playful teasing, she could only do one thing in this magical moment. Follow her heart, allow her emotions to lead and allow the rational, thinking part of her brain to fall to the wayside to make way for something more important than a gimmick. She leaned forward with bated breath, cradling the sides of her face like she was holding the most delicate and precious piece of porcelain the world had ever seen. The swordsmith was worth more than all of the art in the world combined. Her lips scored a touchdown on Hattori’s cheeks where she had drawn her very first heart, like an angel coming down to complete the blessing she had given to her. This was nothing like how it was with Riley, not merely a platonic gentle brush of lips against skin, but a fervent and soulful kiss which made Caramel’s heart race out of her chest and allowed her anxiety to subside to be replaced with butterflies in her stomach. She continued to passionately continue along where every heart had been drawn, stopping each time to speak softly, an unusually warm and evocative tone speaking sweet nothings between kisses.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1307799996388737115 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1307799996388737115><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, 17 November 2024 20:10">20:10</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“You’re the butter to my brownies, always adding richness and tenderness to my life.”

<em>A tender caressing of her cheek with her lips to match the compassion that Hattori had always shown her.</em>

“You’re the clear blue sky that allows the storm to weather you, to not run away even when you’re scared.”

<em>A prolonged smooch followed by a squeezing of her arm, reminding her of the strength of the arms wrapped around Caramel’s waist.</em>

“The bright red raincoat not afraid to get wet if it means getting to see the sky again.”

<em>A quicker but meaningful kiss which represented the split second moment where Hattori had decided to let a silly chocolatier into her heart. Not afraid to be vulnerable or to be saved sometimes.</em>

“The fiery red bandana, beautiful and decidedly bold, ready to take on the gray world of stagnancy.”

<em>A brief sweet kiss, followed by one that lingers in the spot right next to her nose. The beautiful Hattori encouraging Caramel’s hyperactive natural energy, and returning it in full, allowing her to fully be herself.</em>

“And most of all… y-you’re the heat I feel even when I don’t know I’m cold, there to wrap me up like a blanket on a freezing winter evening.” 

<em>She spoke from the chest with every word, empowered by those feelings she had while speaking the truth of how she saw her. Even so, Caramel couldn’t keep her cool at the very end of her eloquent wordplay, as at her core, she still was lacking when it came to experience with topics like this. For someone who had such had such compassion, strength,  vulnerability, beauty, boldness, and empathy… Caramel couldn’t help but feel undeserving but deeply thankful, the blush on her face as red as anyone had ever seen it. Hattori’s face was now covered with distinctive pink lipstick marks all over her cheeks, each one representing another reason why Hattori was so important. For some reason and on some level, Caramel found this deeply cathartic and satisfying on a spiritual level.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1307800032426197063 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1307800032426197063><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, 17 November 2024 20:10">20:10</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“I don’t k-know what I’m feeling… my head is s-spinning, it’s hard to relax… But, all I know is that I just want you.

Despite the kisses being so delicate, each one hit like a berserk bolt of lightning to Hattoris emotions. One shock, then two shocks, another and then another! It was filling her up with this electricity… this palpitating desire to remain in this moment forever. Like chocolate kisses decorating the icing of a cake, they rained down on her cheeks like droplets of sunlight; warm and fuzzy.</em>

<em>Caramel had been the only person to make Hattori feel that way. Not even her ex partner had this affect on her in the few months they were together. Hattori would think about him - she never loved him. She didn’t know what love meant! They were always better off as friends…</em>

“Hummingbird-.”
<em>That&#39;s how Hattori felt. The buzz, the hum of love, and the ability to spread her wings without the fear of faltering.</em>
“That kind of suits you. <em>Hummingbird.”</em>

<em>Hattori prepped her posture up and outstretched her face to Caramel. She balanced herself by putting a hand on Caramel&#39;s thigh and delivered an idyllic kiss to the forehead. Hattori was certain she had discovered the secret ingredient to life&#39;s greatest recipe, and it was Caramel Sweetny. All her worries had floated away on clouds in the sky, for all she felt now was Caramel; and all she wanted was Caramel.</em>

Embracing the great affection she held for Hattori felt like a far less dangerous version of alcohol, though no less addicting, as she felt that she could fall asleep in these arms forever and ever. Caramel had almost snapped out of her stupor fully to come back to reality when she saw the intense physical response pirate lady had in the form of metaphorical shocks, her concern overwhelmingly and effectively disabling her desire to continue. It was the same instinct that stopped a spar from turning into a proper brawl, an empathy to not hurt those you care about. But, upon seeing that she seemed excited and pleased rather than distressed by her kisses, Caramel’s haze and smile returned in full force, looking very pleased with herself as she poured all of her love and affection on to the one who deserved it. 

It was a unique feeling to be indulged this much, showering someone with this much love, and having them react this way felt like she was given a golden ticket to the chocolate factory. Even though she didn’t have an exact label for who this extra special friend of hers, what she did know was that she was unlocking parts of her psyche that hadn’t been explored before. Maybe it was time to ask why you loved it when you could make this beautiful young swordsmith shiver with pleasure with your affection, Caramel? She felt like Hattori held the key to the candy castle, able to unlock the different dessert rooms to eventually find their way to the throne room of the Cocoa Queen that was Caramel. Seeing her continued delight, she planted one final kiss onto the bridge of her nose, looking ever so content and even confident until she become a gibbering mess as she complimented her kissing.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1307876603576979538 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1307876603576979538><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, 18 November 2024 01:14">01:14</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“A-Ah, oh, la dee la… O-Oh um haha…!

<em>She looked nervous but also genuinely bubbly, trying to fall back on the kind of brainrot that she just loved to spout all the time. It was clear to anyone that she was caught in 4K in feelings she couldn’t quite define, divided between the world of the deeper romantic Caramel that was fond of philosophy and was half-decent at sweet-talking through pure sincerity, and the silly entertainer who didn’t like to think too hard. If anyone wanted to truly love and be with Caramel for a long time to come, they would have to accept the two wolves within her. And both wolves were napping and eating chocolate too. The mention of the Hummingbird again made her clasp her hands together and press them against Hattori’s back, her eyes shining as she was touched deeply by the nickname, looking down towards her own lap as if remembering something fondly.</em>

“Y-You remembered… I k-know you had said something like that before but I… really love that!

<em>Caramel closed her eyes as she repeated it, embracing the feeling of being called a hummingbird as it sent a shiver down her spine. She laughs so happily, the room not seeming so dark anymore for her.</em>

“Mom… would have wanted me to be happy no matter what, I had a great childhood with hardly a speck of tragedy. Though… people always wanted me to change. If it was in person, they wanted me to be demure and obedient. If it was online, they wanted me to start doing fan service. The former isn’t me… I just wanna bounce around and do contests and sing at the top of my lungs! And the latter… it’s so funny. So many idols pretend to be pure for profit while teasing their fans but in truth I… I really was sheltered. I’m the exact fantasy they imagine me to be… but… I don’t want to give that part of me to my cubs. I only want to share that… I don’t know, with someone who is more than that.”

<em>The promise to be by her side no matter what, the romance that budded in the air like spring had just arrived, it all brought the perfect environment for Caramel to open up a little. Maybe she subconsciously wanted to tell her that last part, or maybe she was completely unaware. The kiss on her forehead would have halted the story in its path if she hadn’t finished before then, and the touch on her thigh gave an unusually positive reaction too. The blush was coming back and it almost looked like her doggy-ear accessory… perked up?

As she listened intently, she lifted one of her hands to toy with the face-framing layers of her hair, seeming ever so amused as she delicately curled some of the strands around her finger. If Caramel was like sweet syrup, then Hattori was like fluffy pancakes, her hair feeling as smooth and feathery as she imagined. There was an air of honor or perhaps nobility to Hattori, always seeming the type to be direct to her. It was like she was the molten lava cake to her whipped cream, a rich, dense, and stable treat on the outside with a warm gooey center paired with an airy and zesty sweet topping. And Caramel just wanted to have a few bites.</em>

“I really appreciate your understanding pirate lady! We need time to sail the seven seas, and I still gotta fly to get us some nectar!”

<em>Pleaaaase Caramel you’re not literally a hummingbird. She couldn’t help but be reminded of the kiss on her forehead as her hand was left on her thigh, subtly glancing up and obviously failing to look at her own forehead. From being this close and embracing for so long, Hattori could easily tell that Caramel was far heavier than she may have imagined, reflected not only in her wider thighs but also in her legs.</em>

“Hey so… I want to know more about you… if that’s okay with you! Like, what your profession is like day to day. What you like to do? And… you know, how your family dynamic is?”

<em>Especially because her family may be picked for the motive, Caramel wanted to know more about them. Unlike before, Caramel hadn’t disassociated from her trauma, but was managing it internally. Maybe that was the difference between the drug that was Hattori and the many alcoholic bottles that lined the room.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Hattori nodded her head before tapping her chin with a finger. Being reminded of her family sort of took her back to reality. Not this sad, pessimistic reality though. A new, lighter one. It was as if Hattori was seeing everything in a different light, thanks to Caramel.</em>

“My profession mainly consists of smelting and melting down materials to their molten form, and then reshaping them into swords. I do this all at my self-owned shop. Sure, I could make it all machine operated, but then I wouldn’t be so much of a personal Swordsmith would I?”

<em>Hattori took pride in the effort she birthed to every one of her creations. She was a sculptor, an artist, and they were her pieces of work.</em>

“Automation couldn’t get the finest details down like I could.”

<em>The way Hattori trailed on, it was a yap fest! She wanted to tell Caramel EVERYTHING! She was so good at listening and providing her own imput too. Likewise, Hattori would love to listen to the rambles of the streamer too.</em>

“And my family, I mean, I haven’t seen them in a while since I moved to America. But I am on good terms with them all, as you know - my father was my teacher in this profession, my sister and I have grown closer now that we’re older. And my mum, well; as caring as always. Still in our small village, she was a uhh…”

<em>You can say it Hattori, it’s okay. Her mind told her.</em>

“She grew a lot of fruit for our village, somewhat similar to the things Gaeul did.”

<em>the topic of fruit would forever have Hattori’s mind jump back to that fateful day… and now due to this motive? Well, Gaeuls sacrifice may have been for nothing.</em>

“-Nevermind that. I Love my family, I didn’t as a teenager but I was simply Na&#239;ve.”

<em>Her face perked up as Hattori put her hand on top of Caramels’.</em>

“What about you Hummingbird? Anything I should know about your family and life?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Caramel’s hands shifted from Hattori’s back to her own lap, not wanting to overwhelm her despite it feeling like sparkly fireworks in her heart whenever she held her that close. She smiled brightly and nodded at every word, this lady was far too happy! Somebody stop her!</em>

“Too true! Listen, us craftswomen know that you can only make the best product with the best of ingredients, and with our skilled and nimble fingers etching every last detail. I imagine while you were in Japan that you had a license that let you make katanas, kodachi, ōdachi, and more, right? Artisanship is a tricky path with lots of copycats but like, there’s so much beauty in it! When I make a dessert, it’s not just for someone to scarf down, there’s a certain presentation, the way the coconut shavings touch the ever so slightly molted fudge… so I imagine especially with katana that there’s a lot that goes into presenting it too.”

<em>Never had she ever rejected a yap fest, having loved to listen to hours upon hours on end of someone rambling about their craft. Either of them easily could have made bank in their respective industries even with lower-quality products, but they shared a collective pride between them for what truly mattered.</em>

“Oh moved out on your own all the way here, huh? Your family seems chill, I’d love to meet em, and it seems we both have a sister… but like, why come here at all and leave your cool pals?

They had been hugging and had held hands under the desk but somehow, it felt like every touch was re-contextualized with new meaning now.</em>

“Don’t worry, as a kid I was the same way with my fam! I was jealous of the attention my sister got but I was just being a stubborn brat! But about my life… hmm… well I mean, I guess it’s about what part you want to focus on. I was born in a conservatory along with my twin sister… and my life was pretty happy.

<em>…Maybe it was time for a little more truth Caramel. V-Tuber origin stories were fun, but with pirate lady, maybe there was something more you could offer? She looked down at the floor, holding her hand.</em>

“Scratch that. It’s more like… my family really does love me and did their best but like, we were quite poor. I mean like, I had to scavenge for nuts and berries kind of poor. We eventually moved to the city but my dad was always away on business, basically he started a company as a High-End Fashion consultant if you can believe it! It’s why I have such intricate outfits, he always brought me the best silks along with a box of chocolate that was decorated with the prettiest of bows every time he came back… his name was Akira.”

 “No-no, Caramel, it is interesting, trust me.”
<em>She assured Caramel as she discarded the importance by saying none of it was very interesting.</em>

<em>Hattori gave her hand a squeeze to show that she was listening. Funny that Caramels sister went into theatrics; Hattori’s sister had taken a musical path in her life!</em>

<em>To hear the silliness of a volcano filled with chocolate money - classic Caramel imagination, was at first a welcoming giggle.

“Is that..? No, is it-?”

The hand squeeze and assurance that her words matter let her feel comfortable enough to take her hand properly, tracing her thumb along the palm of Hattori’s hand in comforting circles as she interlocked the rest of their fingers.

“Yea… I mean… my dad left us entirely before I became a proper adult, like, the kitchen had been completely cleaned from top to bottom, with even the floors being waxed, and most of the appliances being completely gone. When I came home one day to this, all I could do was read a single note left on the counter, it being the only thing left. All it said was that… well, you’re going to laugh, but it quite literally said that he was going to get some milk and that he’d be right back.”

<em>Caramel didn’t look sad per se, but she did look to be in deep thought, peeking towards the camera every once and again now.</em>

“…I waited for minutes. I waited for hours. I hadn’t eaten anything but I didn’t want to fill up just in case he brought home a surprise. But once the hour turned into a full day of playing on my Nintendo DS and waiting in the room, I decided to open the fridge to get something to eat. It had been completely cleared out and cleaned just as thoroughly as the kitchen, except for one thing. A carton of milk, unopened, and untouched, on the center shelf.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1308317020831486033 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1308317020831486033><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, 19 November 2024 06:24">06:24</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>She looked off to the side, gritting her teeth with a slightly furrowed brow, and a narrowed gaze.

Whatever it was, it was cursed as all hell seeing anything resembling that emotion on her face, even if there was just a hint of it that disappeared instantly.</em>

“After that message, I was stunned. I waited and waited but nothing happened. Eventually I opened the bottle of milk… and poured it in a mixing bowl. I mixed together a ton of makeshift ingredients, anything I could find laying around my room. And that’s how… I made my first dessert and started my career.”

<em>She looked back towards Hattori, her eyes were startlingly calm but warmed upon seeing her listening.</em>

“When I think of that experience along with the other clues, and what the King is doing now, I can’t help but think it’s possible. Possible for a hero to fall… I guess.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Hattori outstretched herself around Caramel for yet another hug. This was a weary topic and Caramel was clearly iffy on discussing it. Therefore Hattori will do whatever she can to put Caramel at ease.</em>

“I think… if he is your father-,”

<em>Hattori gulped as she said it herself.</em>

“You shouldn’t pay attention to it. He’s a sick man, and on top of that he left you, forever affecting your life.”

<em>Hattori felt harsh for saying it, but that was her honest belief.</em>

“If they are the same person then so be it. But you’re not like him. You’re Caramel Sweetney! And you’re a million times better than he is.”

<em>She leaned in and gave her a peck on the cheek. Her heart racing of course, but this was from a place of empathy, of comfort.</em>

“It’s fine, I just… when people are suffering or in pain, even if they’re hurting other people, I just wanna reach out to help. Tremaine and Jax like I said before but, I think I’ve lost that desire for Akira. And it’s just not a habit I want to get into, I don’t ever want to abandon anyone.”

<em>The fragile words of a girl with some clear issues were naive but hopeful. Caramel embraces the hug and kept things light, not offended or pleased about her words comparing the king and the chocolatier. At this point, she was just exhausted. The kiss on the cheek reawakened a quicker heart rate within, her worry over their situation mutating to a nervousness that was far more pleasant to experience.</em>

“…I’ll try to open up when that happens, I really am working on it. But like, I want you to do the same… I want to know everything, even what you think the boring stuff is. I want to know your favorite food, what you like for gifts, your favorite memory with your father, what your sister does for a living, just <em>everything</em>. In time of course haha you don’t have to, like, info-dump if you don’t wanna rn. I want to see <em>you</em>.”

<em>Caramel may have heterochromia but those words were anything but straight. Not that she quite aware of it herself of course. Inside, she knew that there time in the tent would come to an end sometime soon, but before it did, she selfishly wanted a little bit more. The gift of a hint into more and more of Hattori’s heart. She left her little speech with one more gift of her own, deeply kissing the side of her neck and cheekily giggling as she backed away.

<em>Whispering into her ear seemed to be the right thing to do, frying her defenses and reminding her of when other women jokingly did that to her in the locker room. Why was everything so different now? Caramel focused on Hattori for one final time, squeezing her into the hug with as much comfort and sweetness as she could possibly give, and then finally letting go with a quirky smile. They had grieved over what had happened to their friend, explored a developing and very close “friendship” that they held, and even told each other about their pasts.</em>
