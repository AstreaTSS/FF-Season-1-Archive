Khuong sighed a little to himself as he made his way towards the dorm area. There was a lot to think about when it came to this place, but his mind was circulating currently on the desire to simply rest for a bit.

He looked over at the area, eyeballing the small lightbulbs that were hanging from a thread. It looked pretty colorful here, definitely a contrast from the events that just transpired earlier.

Hmmm...

He crossed his arms, looking at him now. He curiously cocked his head to the side. &quot;Nah, I&#39;m never okay. I think I&#39;m gonna retch from the murder I just saw. It&#39;s all fresh in my mind, no thanks to you.&quot;

He shrugged.

“Huh… so, like torture or something? I doubt you’re aiming for emotional baggage here. Y’all seem more interested in the violence and gore side of things than the emotional angst and storylines.”

Well, he guessed that made sense. He had no reason to really argue Akira on that point.

&quot;Hm, true. I guess I can understand it given that&#39;s how people end up invested in reality shows,&quot; he said, shrugging. &quot;It&#39;s just a bit of a shame that this whole thing&#39;s completely live. At least in reality shows you have to either put up an act or the cameras show certain scenes or shit... Y&#39;know, like how they pick someone to be the show&#39;s villain or shit.&quot;

He chuckled. &quot;I&#39;m into that if it&#39;s fiction. This is real life and I&#39;m not really in the mood to investigate into more serious matters. I&#39;d rather just relax and watch something cute or something.&quot;

A sigh escaped his lips. &quot;Yeah...? What&#39;s the ratings like so far? Guessing that the people who spoke out the most are the favorites right now?&quot;

<em>He pulled out his ePad from the inside of his jacket, before proceeding to tap onto some things, aaaaand... Done! He had a list of all the stats relating to the game, such as the ratings, the likes received, and even the chat&#39;s many, many comments. From the looks of it, most of the cast had been favored by someone already.</em>

&quot;Most people seem to have a very high amount of likes, with the lowest ratings being for... You, Felix Grey, Kinto Dol, and Pocket.&quot;

<em>He looked away from his tablet, then back at Khuong, before shrugging it off and pocketing his tablet once more. It was a 7 inch tablet, so it was relatively easy to hide in your clothes.</em>

&quot;I recommend spicing your game up. Bad things tend to happen to those who don&#39;t get a lot of ratings. Trust me, I know.&quot;

<em>He let out another wicked laugh.</em>

He then raised a brow. 

“Like what? People just laughing at you dying or something? That happens no matter what anyways. If I’m dead, I’m just a statistic on the board. Nothing too crazy. That and maybe I’d get my death shown on social media platforms for a while.”

The collar feels like a pair of hands, waiting to choke him out when he least expects it. Like a predator awaiting the prime moment to sink its teeth into its prey.
Pocket knows, realistically, that won&#39;t happen. But it feels as though water has filled his ears, unable to listen to the reason of logical thinking as his instinct desperately wishes to assume the worst.
He&#39;s hyperaware of the collar. The way it digs into his skin if he so much as turns his head. It hurts more than it actually does; it&#39;s stressing him out. The constant touch is already driving him crazy. It&#39;s like the hosts knew exactly what buttons to push; it peeved and stressed him to no end.

In a desperate attempt to control his breathing and calm himself down, Pocket has resorted to simply... going back to his tent. Maybe he just needed to lay down and clear his head. Or perhaps he needs to scream into a pillow.

Nevertheless. He&#39;s here. Out in the open. And likely not paying much attention to his surroundings.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>PUNCH</strong>
[Constitution: 67/100]

Pocket suddenly finds himself with the wind knocked out of him. It felt like a cannonball had collided with his back.
Before he could even comprehend who it was, he abruptly makes a heel turn his hand balled into a fist. Blinded by adrenaline, he goes for a retaliation punch-

<strong>Shock: Medium</strong>
&quot;ΣΚΑΤΆ.&quot; A greek profanity slips from his mouth as the collar suddenly activates, noticably weakening the force of his punch.
[Strength: 48]
His misaimed punch only seems to graze Fumi&#39;s shoulder as he stumbles, now just desperately trying to catch his breath after getting punched and getting shocked. His heartbeat is in his head, he appears to be hyperventilating, seemingly entered a state of fight or flight.
&quot;. . .. Πουτάνας γιος- fuck- shit. I-&quot; he lets out a pretty painful sounding cough as his vision clears up. A girl. Pink hair. He can&#39;t link a name to the face. Stranger. Dangerous? Unsure.
Did he hurt her? Even he can&#39;t tell if his punch landed. He can&#39;t tell the difference between a rock and a hard place.
&quot;Hhh. I&#39;- sorry. I&#39;m- sorry. I&#39;m-&quot; hes trying to sputter an apology while catching his breath and it isnt working.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=orange_heart><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=🧡 src=1275324129482113055.html_Files/1f9e1-18A30.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=frowning2><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=☹️ src=1275324129482113055.html_Files/2639-A08FE.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

The grave keeper moved himself to stand besides Akira. And when the king wasn&#39;t looking, Lucien sneakily reached for Akira&#39;s gun. Just when Lucien thought he had it, the gun slipped out of his hands and clattered on the ground.

A crossbow could be found near the 2nd dorm tent. The end of the crossbow is coated in a thick layer of blood. The weapon is not very well hidden.

And then she killed the only guy that Jax planned on continuing speaking with. Sure. they had Lucien now, but it still…sucked. 

Jaxon had done his obligatory lap of the grounds after the trial, finishing up here and sitting against the wall. Funnily enough, it was more comfortable than their own bed. His bed <em>sucked</em>.
Everything sucked right now. The constant anxiety of potentially losing Lucien when he wasn’t in their sight especially didn’t help.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

21 people is what we started with; now there was only 9. The circus has never felt more cramped and claustrophobic.

Pocket didn&#39;t speak to Fumi much at all- in fact, the most he recalled was the time she punched him, in this very hallway...
She was. Chill. Perhaps even friendly; he&#39;s sure they could&#39;ve became friends had the situation not been what it was.
But dwelling on that was pointless.

Pocket&#39;s eyes are remarkably empty as he enters the hallway. He sees Jaxon, but almost pays no mind to them; hell, he nearly walks right past. But his gut, heaven forbid, insists to do <em>something.</em>
With a heavy sigh, The mechanic&#39;s brow raises as he peers at Jax.
&quot;. . . Jax,&quot; he greets in a low voice; such rasp suggested he hasn&#39;t spoken in awhile.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Jaxon could only hope Pocket wasn’t in a terribly grumpy mood. 
“…Pocket.”
They bit the inside of their cheek, wanting to ask Pocket to stay and sit with him. Jaxon wanted company, honestly. And if it was going to be from anyone, it’d be Lucien or Pocket.

Pocket didn&#39;t seem to be in a grumpy mood; rather, his mood was indiscernible. He seemed.... numb.
He thinks back to the trial. He thinks about Uriel, who was wrecked by it.
Bitterly, he feels a twisted gratification in his soul. The law of equivalent exchange, perhaps?
....

Internally, Pocket knew that his anger was still misplaced. Selfish indulgment only got him so far.
With a long huff, the mechanic shuffles to where Jax is seated and (albeit shakily) sits down near them. 
With a trembling hand, he pulls off his beanie; his long curls cascade down his shoulders. &quot;....and you?&quot; he asks shortly, fingers running through his brown locks as he asks.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=heart_eyes><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=😍 src=1275324129482113055.html_Files/1f60d-BEAFF.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Not far off his own involvement with Fumi. They’d had a less than good impression, so Jax had no problem voting her guilty over such small evidence. 
Maybe their morals were going completely out the window — but it wouldn’t be the first time such questions were pondered. 

…Oh, wow, that’s a lot of hair. It suited him, Jax wasn’t sure why he hadn’t expected him to have long hair. Must have been difficult to shove it all up into a hat. 
“I’ve been better. I think I’m…coping better. With everything.”
They averted their eyes from Pocket. 
“Haven’t, uh, physically abused anyone else.”

A part of Jax was envious of Pocket, but for such a petty reason now. Maybe that feeling would never go away, even if it was for something completely unrelated to Apollo. 
“I, uh…your hair looks nice.”
Awkward ass…</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kicking people in their sides wasn&#39;t exactly enjoyable for the kicker and the kicker receiver.

Jaxon was recovering slowly- that was good to hear. &quot;Mm... m&#39;glad.&quot; He glances at Jax blankly. He wished it was easier for himself, admittedly; but... he&#39;d live. Surely.
The awkward compliment causes a half wheeze half chuckle to leave Pocket as his brow raises. &quot;Thanks...&quot; he says, the slightest remnants of a smile tugs the corner of his lips. &quot;...m&#39;flattered. Truly.&quot;

.....
No, it&#39;d be fun to get a small reaction out of him, Pocket decides.
&quot;Didn&#39;t take y&#39;fer th&#39;lover boy type.&quot; he replies, his voice gives away his teasing nature instantly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Jaxon had had a long time mourning. Maybe it was easier having friends around to support him, maybe that’s why he was getting better. 
Who knew, isolating yourself only makes everything more miserable!
“Don’t— Don’t laugh at me!”

He sulked at the teasing, folding his arms like a little bitch. 
“Shut up. Can’t even compliment a guy anymore. Shut up.”
Jaxon was very much the lover boy type, just see how they’d been with Apollo! He wasn’t upset with Pocket’s teasing, but he sure as hell wasn’t gonna admit such a thing without clearly displaying his disagreement.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They lightly pushed Pocket’s shoulder, more teasing back than anything. His laugh was nicer than how he’d sounded when he’d told Jax to get lost…eesh!

“Oh, uh. Tha— Thanks.”
Jaxon wasn’t expecting a compliment in return, and reached up a hand to touch his own hair. Why? To check it was still there? Freak.

They went silent for a while, debating whether or not to say what was on their mind. 
“Sorry if this is, like, completely out of nowhere. But you haven’t got any more…weird messages sent from you, right?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Jax is being surprisingly open lately. A few weeks ago, he’d never dream of saying such a thing to anyone at all. Maybe this whole situation was changing them for the better.

It was calming in a way, to no longer care one way or the other, the way that the numbing stench of alcohol took away the pain.

She was walked from one of the tents, covered in dirt once again, but no longer carrying Hattori’s body. Her arms sometimes curled upwards, as if expecting to find her still within her embrace, though there was nothing there any more of course. Dazed, she slumped against the wall, checking her cell phone for notifications.

What was one to do when they had been through all the good and the bad that the world had to offer? Remain still and pray that nothing happened, she supposed. It wasn’t like she had any friends, a partner, or even an audience to lean on anymore.</em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, 21 December 2024 23:00">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Mumbling out an apology, Jaxon retrieved his glasses from his pockets and put them on. They looked marginally more approachable with them on. 

“Caramel.”
He stood over her, unsure what to say. They couldn’t really say something that they would have wanted to hear when they were in her position. As socially inept as he was, he knew he was an outlier for how he preferred to be comforted. They wanted to talk to her, though. Doddy was avoiding him, and Pocket wasn’t much a fan of him either from what he could tell. 
They’d make the most of having any company at all, and then…waste away, they supposed. 

He sat by her side, leaning his head back against the wall. 
“H-Hi. Uhh…”
The nerves were clear in their voice. Upsetting the vtuber further was the last thing he wanted to do, not right now. Now wasn’t the time. Maybe they’d make an enemy out of her when Hattori’s death was a little less fresh, but now was not a good time. He knew that much. 
They just had no idea how to talk to her.

“…Yes? What is it?”

<em>She wasn’t making the best eye contact, gazing around at her surrounding, silently wishing that such a foul-mouthed rude person would leave her alone. Even though she had been numbed to the painful memories she had encountered, his unsympathetic remarks towards those who had their friends and family killed was not lost on her, not forgetting all the times he had risked their lives for his benefit.

It was like their roles were reversed; Before Caramel would have endured his verbal assault to understand him. Now, it was him that had to do the reaching out, trying different strategies to bond. The moment his idea was revealed, she rolled his eyes dramatically, moving her foot closer to the exit, but not taking a step yet. Caramel made what she believed to be a pretty safe assumption about his real intentions with such a question.</em>

“I am not killing you, no matter how much you ask. I would never turn into more of a monster than I already am, I’d rather die before ever betraying everyone like that. Gaeul was probably one of the best among us, cause she understood that.”

I mean, obviously she felt bad. That much was obvious from context clues. Oddly enough, her face didn’t reflect how Jaxon thought she’d be feeling…which really threw him off. It didn’t seem right that she’d be so calm after losing her girlfriend. 
Though, they thought back on their conversation with Hattori. It sounded like she’d plucked up the courage to say something. There was something resembling pride in him thinking about it, which was almost immediately trampled by the fact that she’d now died. 

The parkourist wasn’t meeting her eyes either, instead studying every other aspect of her face for anything that could possibly gauge her mood. This blank-faced expression was terrible to deal with, and Jaxon wished she’d just say exactly how she was feeling so he knew where they stood. But alas, such wishes weren’t going to come true. It, unfortunately, wasn’t how the world worked. 
“I don’t want to go to bed. It’s boring. Everything is <em>fucking</em> boring, I’m going insane here.”
They didn’t deny their nervousness, though. There was no need, how anxious he felt speaking to her was proof enough. 

There’d been more than enough lies coming from Jaxon lately. This wasn’t one of them. Their hands shook as they stood before her, and they felt pathetic. This was the first time he’d spoken to her properly since she’d stabbed him, and he was trembling? They’d made a name for themself as the one here that was so full of shit, making jokes at everyone’s expenses, and now they were shaking at the mere prospect of a conversation. How he’d fallen. 
“…”
Jaxon shrugged.
“Worth a shot.”

They fiddled with their hoodie strings, looking at her. It didn’t feel right to lie to her, not in this state, at least. 
“You wouldn’t get to go home anyway. It’s not me. And I don’t think it’s Doddy, and I want to doubt it’s you or Pocket.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1320239547958689832 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1320239547958689832><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, 22 December 2024 04:00">04:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Pinching the bridge of their nose, Jaxon continued. 
“I don’t know who it is. I don’t even believe that Akira would let us go free even if we <em>did</em> somehow kill them.”

The memories of people long dead had been bouncing around Jaxon’s mind for weeks at this point. Everything he did was always so full of grief, with no escape from the things his own mind insisted on reminding him of. Apollo sitting with him after Felix’s death. Yuri comforting them after they’d been shot, calling them her son. Lucien letting him cry on his shoulder. 
All of them long gone. The fact that Lucien had killed someone stung the worst. It wasn’t any of the others’ choices, but Lucien’s was fully his own doing. And so brutally, too. Even if they hated him now, they still found themselves aching for his company. Desperately wishing he’d come back, even though it wasn’t at all feasible. 

“…If that’s what you want to think of me, I’m not going to correct you. I just— I just don’t want to see anyone else die. I don’t want you guys to die.”
Biting his lip, he fought back a sob.
“I can’t do it anymore. Please don’t die. Hide if you have to. Just— Just please.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This was the first trial where it wasn’t a friend of his having died, and yet he still felt just as terrible having argued with Doddy afterwards. That look in her eyes was the same. And if they could recognise that, they could recognise how she was feeling.
Terrible. 
Mournful. 

Jax’s usual scowl was long gone, replaced by an expression one could only describe as desolate. That was a pretty good word to describe a lot of things at the moment, he thought. The carnival. How many people were left. Their feelings towards…anything, as of late. Jax felt he was more similar to this version of Caramel than he’d expected to be. Repeated trauma does strange things to people.
Jaxon hadn’t cried in a while, and had no intention of it. He’d accepted the situation, quite simply. Everyone was dead. And they’d never see any of them again, not unless they died too. And with most of his weapons missing, that wasn’t on the table for the time being anyway. 
The feeling of being sober was alien in the moment. There wasn’t anything to find funny, and Jaxon could barely find the words to communicate with Caramel. He did want to help, but he didn’t understand her. One thing she was definitely different to them about was how she would want to be comforted. Jaxon hated being pitied, that much he’d made quite clear, but it seemed to have confused Caramel. If she didn’t understand that, then what <em>would</em> she want?
They brought their hand up to their mouth, chewing harshly on the skin around their nails. He was psyching himself out over this.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1320473750583382208 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1320473750583382208><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, 22 December 2024 19:31">19:31</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“I think it’s been a long time coming. Lucien really…fucked me over. And everyone else. I don’t know.”
Truthfully, Jax believed it had started when he’d watched Felix die. But Lucien’s betrayal was a turning point, a breaking point. It was as though someone had taken away some small part of their brain. Not enough to kill him, but enough to make everything different. They viewed people differently, determined to make no more friends. He viewed himself differently, a waste of space with nothing to offer those he cared about. Whatever the case, Jaxon wasn’t the same person that had befriended Lucien, and they certainly weren’t the guy joking with Felix way back at the start. 

He didn’t know who exactly had replaced him, but whoever it was, they were a worse person than he’d ever been. 

Their hands trembled as they rested in front of their face, still chewing on their nails. He winced sharply in pain, having drawn blood, but quickly shoved the sensation down and pressed his opposite thumb into his bleeding finger. 
There was something Jaxon regretted. Overreacting to that fight. Of course, it was the added pain of the numerous shocks he’d received at the time that left him with such a bad taste in his mouth. They’d never really gotten past that, had they? He was still so bitter about it, even knowing that it wasn’t her fault. 
But even if their fight was on better terms, Jaxon wouldn’t have changed, no matter how hard Caramel may have tried in such a scenario. He was firmly stuck in his ways, and in his head it would have either ended with her death or her leaving him, figuring out there was nothing that could be done to change him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1320473899271720960 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1320473899271720960><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, 22 December 2024 19:31">19:31</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>To Jaxon’s surprise, the words hurt more than they’d expected. Usually he couldn’t have cared less about Caramel’s opinion of him, but implying he was selfish was…not something he’d ever enjoyed. That and pity…two things they couldn’t stand. 
“I don’t— I wasn’t—”
Jaxon squeezed their eyes shut, trying and failing to compose themself. 
“I’m not trying to be selfless. I’m not trying to be some noble sacrifice. I’ve wished I was dead this whole time, especially after Yu—”
A sudden break in his words as his voice choked up. They cleared their throat. 
“After Yuri…<em>died</em>. I’ve been trying to die this whole time.”
Biting his lip, he murmured out a few more words. 
“I’m too much of a coward to do it myself. I’m scared. ‘s fucking pathetic.”

They shook their head, dismissing her apology. Though, it was less of a lack of forgiveness and more him simply denying that she’d need to. 
Jaxon took whatever insults people threw at them nowadays. He didn’t care enough to deny them, or perhaps it was simply because he knew most of what people were saying about him was entirely true. 

“…Do you think it’s anyone at all? Like, what if Akira’s sending us on a chase after someone we’ve never even seen?”
Okay, ultimate conspiracy theorist. Shut up. 

It was a miracle and a half he’d managed to decipher her emotions at all, if I’m being honest. Empathy was far from Jaxon’s strong suit, so maybe it was because they saw so much of their own feelings written across her face. That heartbreak, the exhaustion, it was all there. Even if she buried it beneath some sort of neutrality, it was there. It wasn’t dissimilar at all to how Jaxon had hidden his own feelings when he was younger. Of course, now, their go-to cover for their true feelings was lashing out, flying into a rage and shouting at people. That much was obvious. But his restraint from shouting at Caramel was an indication that something completely different was going on in his head. No outward rage to be found.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1320473972055212064 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1320473972055212064><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, 22 December 2024 19:32">19:32</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>But bringing up Lucien, that seemed to change. 
“L— Lucien…said that?”
Jaxon’s mind began to spiral down into a rabbit hole of thoughts, their inner voice becoming louder and louder until it drowned out Caramel completely. 
Lucien had…<em>planned</em> for his death? Sure, maybe it would be just a nothing if he’d been murdered. You can’t help that, really. But having killed someone, and planned for after your death?
Lucien had a plan for it. All of it. Lucien knew he was going to die, and had lied straight to Jax’s face over and over, when they were so vulnerable and desperate for companionship. 
He’d promised. He’d sworn he wouldn’t leave, knowing that he was going to. Why? <em>Why?!</em> What did he gain from it? Was it purely to make Jax suffer more?
Perhaps that was why he’d seemingly been not at all worried about the curse Jaxon spoke about. He knew he was going to kill someone and get executed anyway, so what, was he just planning on abandoning Jax regardless?
They’d loved him. More than anything at the time, more than anything now. Everything Jax had done, he’d been thinking about Lucien, worrying about him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1320474030863814666 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1320474030863814666><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, 22 December 2024 19:32">19:32</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Knowing that all that energy was wasted on someone who knew they were going to die anyway filled Jax with absolute grief.

Jax was forgiving, when it came to friends. They always looked for the best in them. He’d forgiven everyone else, but Lucien was different. 

Jaxon fucking hated him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1320474087658618911 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1320474087658618911><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, 22 December 2024 19:32">19:32</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The parkourist had gone deadly silent for a long time after Caramel had finished speaking.

“If…if that’s what he told you to do, I don’t want you to take care of me. I hate him. I don’t care if I’m speaking ill of the dead. I fucking <em>hate</em> Lucien. I hope he’s suffering. It’s not fair. Don’t respect his fucking wishes if it has anything to do with me.”
Gone was the gentler, tired tone they’d been using before, since everything had happened. Now replaced with what everyone expected from him; a bitter, angry tone. Their fists clenched at their sides, chewed-up nails digging into their palms.

Jax didn’t notice her omission of nicknames at all. Maybe it was because he didn’t speak to her too often, or maybe it was because he was so wrapped up in his own grief that he wasn’t aware of anything else. 

“I’m sorry.”
They went quiet again for a while, tears threatening their eyes as they sat and listened to Caramel speak. 
“…I don’t know if I want you to trust me. I don’t think it’s fair to. You know I can’t promise that. If someone tried to kill me, I’d fuckin’ help them.”
He let out a slow breath. 
“Sorry. I just don’t want you to die. Because I’ll— it’ll be my fault. So I’m gonna keep my distance.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The exception to prove the rule was that one moment between her and Riley, her blinding rage replaying in her head an infinite amount of times, driving her up the wall. She had been willing to extend a hand to even the psychopathic Lillith in the past, but the destruction of the symbol of all that she held dear was just too much for her to bear, making her as hysterical as she could ever be. Looking at a viper who had always been everything she wasn’t, now unable to bear the poison that he himself had always dosed to others in high quantities, she couldn’t help but compare their shared look of emptiness.

Ever since she came to this accursed place, Caramel didn’t allow others’ care for hers to manifest in her heart in such a negative way, but throughout the course of all that had happened, her ability to accept this tenderness had been yanked away from her forcefully. The fundamental difference was if one would allow empathy into their heart, regardless of if they had come to the carnival or not.

Second-guessing all that he had done… though that was a marked improvement, her own mind recalling the stabbing especially as the one mistake on her part regarding him.

Even now, there was still a barrier of some kind between her and all of her emotions, like she could logically reason how she should feel without being able to produce it outwardly in an obvious way. It was only Jaxon’s personal experience with similar feelings that let him read her at all, especially with her tone being as even-keeled as it had been this entire time. She was reminded of a begging dog when looking at him now, one who had lost its bite. It was hard to quantify exactly what she thought of that right now, constant repression that was now a habit making everything around her seem less vibrant and grayer than it had ever been. Moving through sludge in slow motion, she wearily evaluated him as she mentioned Lucien, her eyes narrowing in confusion at this strong reaction to her words about the man.</em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, 23 December 2024 19:22">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1320832887259402291 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1320832887259402291><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, 23 December 2024 19:18">19:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“…Yes…?

<em>It didn’t take much deductive reasoning to figure out that Jaxon was having an existential crisis over what she gathered to be his best friend’s last wish. Watching the mixture of regret and betrayal wash over him like a windy chill did evoke some amount of empathy within her, having experienced that feeling over and over herself. Although Lucien had made the mistake of taking lives for his own selfish desires, it didn’t mean that his last wishes were any less valuable. They were still a person who had comforted her greatly after Fumi’s trial, and who deserved to have their last desires fulfilled. Even if she still felt the sting of him being a turncoat to the group, and no longer considered him a friend, that didn’t negate what he wanted in life. Although it wasn’t a pleasant memory to be reminded of, Caramel felt… well, with the limited emotions she had right now, she felt a little ‘brighter’.

<em>The surprise at his shift in attitude was quickly overcome by something else. A build-up of something within her, more and more, the thin threads making up the restraints that held her back beginning to snap. The atmosphere changed as Jaxon backpedaled and slid into his own ways, negating the one bit of positivity that could be drawn from his changed personality, and going back to old habits. Utterly disrespecting every effort that Lucien had made to leave something behind, for her to build a bond with him when he was gone that would be unmarred by a betrayal. A mission that could definitely be fulfilled, with her unwilling to kill anyone. When he began to apologize to her personally so pathetically after saying such things about Lucien, everything changed in their dynamic.</em>

Her ePad was shoved towards his face to reveal a secret photo taken of Hattori, smiling brightly and laughing at one of her many dumb jokes, looking as happy as could be. A face unmarred by blood and gore. Her voice for the briefest of moments, was able to express the depth of her pain mixed crudely with her seething.</em>

“For the sake of… her. For… my tender and sweet Pirate Lady. The one who showed me it was okay to be me, that a miserable imposter was worthy of <em>love</em>. She liked you too! She had hope for you to be better…! Break the cycle… and surpass me.”

It had always been a bad habit, shutting people out and making sure they stay out without a second thought. Ever since Tea had left their life, Jaxon hadn’t wanted anyone else. The disappearance of his friend was the tipping point. They’d had companions in school after that, but they weren’t friends. They didn’t like him, and he didn’t like them. But anything at all was better than being bullied like when he’d been a child. 

Jaxon wasn’t a good person. Not anymore. Maybe there was some good in them, somewhere, but it was buried beneath layers of grief, pent-up rage and resentment, and fortified walls that they now refused to let anyone past, no matter how hard they tried. 
It never made him better, never improved him as a person. All it ever did was build up that grief and resentment to make everything more difficult. 

Having been so cruel for a good part of their life, it wasn’t ever a problem. People didn’t push back when he pushed them away. So seeing people so compassionate, so convinced that there was something underneath that they’d try to break through all those layers…it was a foreign concept. Now Jaxon put more energy into pushing back, and all that harshness, all that cruelty was more to bear than he was able to. 
Jax didn’t want to be vulnerable with people. Least of all Caramel. But that venom was withering his stubbornness away, whether that was a good or a bad thing.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1320884183878598780 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1320884183878598780><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, 23 December 2024 22:42">22:42</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Whatever it translated to in their brain, compassion and empathy weren’t something they were familiar with receiving. Perhaps that was why he was so averse to it. Jaxon wasn’t the best at dealing with change, and a change of people’s treatment of them was one of the worst to become accustomed to. Everything inside of the parkourist contrasted with people attempting to show care and understanding for him. Jaxon was bitter, and set in their ways. The very concept that someone wanted to try and see past that was terrible. It filled him with this twisted sort of warmth, but not one of friendship. It felt sickly, especially so nowadays. People attempting to get through to them was sickening, simply because his steadily declining sanity led him to believe that anyone becoming friends with him would die.
If Caramel had wanted a better Jaxon, one that could possibly be a better person, it would have had to have been before Yuri’s death. 
After that? There was little hope for them. 

Listening to Caramel lecture him again, Jaxon averted his gaze to his shoes. They were dirty, and falling apart. Not too dissimilar to how they’d been when they’d arrived here. 
“…She’d think less of me now. I’ve done nothing redeemable since she died. I’ve killed out of spite, I’ve tried to get you all killed, I’ve pushed everyone away. She wouldn’t want me as a son if she could see me now.”
His own words pricked tears at the corners of his eyes, as he fought them back with everything he had in him. They weren’t going to cry here. Not now.
“I can’t take care of a child, Caramel. I can’t. I’m barely able to look after myself. If I ever get out of here, I won’t be surprised if I just waste away. I can’t. I’m— I’m not responsible enough. I’m not kind enough.”
They shook their head, chewing harshly on their hoodie’s sleeve. 
“All I can do is run away. It’s all I’m good for. I’ve been running away from everything since I was a kid. I don’t know how to do anything else.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1320884294058639370 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1320884294058639370><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, 23 December 2024 22:42">22:42</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The idea that it could possibly be Doddy tugged at his heartstrings. As much as they refused to be friends with anyone here, thinking they could be working against them was heartwrenching. 

Jaxon…surprisingly enough didn’t think she was being unfair. Whether it was a genuine agreement or some sort of fawn response, he didn’t feel the need to argue with her. Maybe it was their responsibility to take care of what Yuri had left behind. 
But that was a responsibility he couldn’t physically take on, not in this state. Jaxon was a better sibling figure than they were a parent, but both of those were out of the window in such a mindset as this one they’d been stuck in for weeks. 
Jaxon’s bite on his sleeve was harsher between words about Lucien. Their jaw clenched, but they tried their hardest not to snap at Caramel. It wasn’t her fault that Lucien was such a horrible person in his eyes. 
“No he didn’t. Everything he ever did to me was a lie. I don’t forgive him. I won’t forgive him. He didn’t give two shits. He lied to my face, over and over. That’s not something you do to someone you care about.”

It was another foreign feeling that Lucien’s betrayal evoked in his chest. There were few people they’d loved that they couldn’t forgive. In fact, Jaxon struggled to think of any others. 
But in his mind, Lucien took advantage of him. That hole left from all of their friends dying around them, filling it just to leave too. And he had the nerve to cry, to beg for forgiveness and leave him his broach. Jaxon wanted to forget he’d ever existed. It wasn’t strange to not be able to forgive, for once. It was different with Caramel. She wasn’t a friend, she’d been a stranger. Lucien had been…<em>everything</em> to them. For that time, his whole world had revolved around him. Their every feeling depended on Lucien’s approval, his love, his care. 
All that, and Lucien still couldn’t help himself leaving. 
Jaxon despised him. Every part of the gravekeeper…it all meant nothing to him anymore.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1320884393790931054 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1320884393790931054><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, 23 December 2024 22:43">22:43</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Yeah. I did. And he didn’t deserve any of it. I trusted him. He promised me, over and over, that he wasn’t going to die. And he’d <em>planned</em> for it. He told you what to do when he died. He knew he was going to fucking kill her, and he still promised me everything. Getting out together. He let me have hope for once, for the first time in a long time. And he <em>knew</em> it was all a lie.”
The tears threatening to fall finally cascaded as Jaxon concluded his sentence, his expression crumbling into a display of what could only be described as utter despair after a long, long time of attempting to keep it somewhat neutral. 
“I hope— I hope he’s suffering. I don’t want him to get away with playing with my feelings like that. It’s not fair. None of what he did is fair.”

As the tears continued to fall, Jaxon didn’t want to look at Caramel. Nothing he could say would save his pride now. It was useless to try. All they could do was avoid her gaze and pray for her to leave. He hated being here, talking to her as if she’d even liked him to begin with. Maybe they could have been friends. If Lucien had been murdered instead of being the killer himself, maybe this could be helped. Maybe he’d have taken her offer of companionship, for the sake of his dead friend. 
But Lucien had burned that bridge all on his own, without thinking about it. All Jax could think about was that broach, and how he’d seen it sitting on the floor of the trial room while they’d discussed the previous case. Nobody had picked it up. Maybe it was intended for them, but Jaxon didn’t want it. He hated reminders of what he’d lost. With Hattori having died with that locket they’d given her, Jaxon had relinquished all ties to any of their past. 

Being yelled at was…honestly, not what he wanted or needed. They took a step back, finally looking Caramel in the eyes as she shouted. It was disrespectful not to look at someone as they were shouting at you. He knew that from experience. It’d be worse if they didn’t look</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, 23 December 2024 22:43">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1320884395317399562 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1320884395317399562><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, 23 December 2024 22:43">22:43</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>. 
His tears gradually stopped, strangely enough. They bowed their head slightly, still looking at her as she continued to shout. He stayed silent, even a few moments after she’d finished just to ensure he didn’t interrupt her. 
“You— You’re—”
The words continued to catch in their throat as they attempted to compose themself enough to respond. He hadn’t been shouted at like that in a long time.
They moved their hair out of their face, an unconscious action. 
“…You’re…right. I don’t know how to fix it. Or make it up to you. I’m…just so sorry. R-Really. I’m sorry for overreacting about the fight we had. It isn’t your fault. I shouldn’t have kept a grudge. And I’m sorry for being so…rude. And horrible. And…just the worst. I’m so sorry. My trauma isn’t an excuse to be cruel to other people.”
His voice was shaky, but measured. They thought carefully about every sentence before it came out, a stark contrast to their usual method of saying whatever comes to mind. 

“I’m sorry.”
Jaxon’s hands trembled, going back towards his face to chew at the skin around his nails again. It was almost a grounding feeling, that pain. 
“I’ve never wanted help. All I’ve ever wanted was to just…waste away. I’m sorry. F-For apologising.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1320884612485877852 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1320884612485877852><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, 23 December 2024 22:43">22:43</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It was probably not a response that was typical of them. But feeling so beaten down, so tired, Jaxon couldn’t help but fall into old habits, even older than before his arrival at the carnival. They hadn’t been so passive since…being a kid. Sitting on the couch as his father stood over him, lecturing and yelling at him about something new every time. Nothing was ever good enough. The only way to ease the tension was to agree, and apologise. Admit mistakes, and never blame the other person. It was never Dad’s fault. It wasn’t Caramel’s. It was Jaxon’s. 
As stubborn as he was, Jaxon wasn’t a strong person. Their mental state had been less than good arriving here, which was perhaps why it took so little to break them. But this was, by far, the worst they’d ever felt. Even after his mom’s suicide, even after Tea’s departure from his life…he hadn’t felt so hopeless. 

Jaxon didn’t want any more chances. They didn’t want to be treated with dignity, or with compassion. He wanted exactly what he deserved; to be shunned and cut off from everyone else here. 
They shook their head in response. It was rhetorical, but still better to respond with agreement than be accused of not listening at all. 
“No— I’m sorry—”
Jaxon continued to watch her carefully, something new in his eyes that hadn’t been there before. 
<em>Fear.</em>
Did she scare them? Quite possibly. She was loud, and harsh, and spoke so similarly to the one other person in his life he feared more.

The look in her eyes had them stepping back, scared for what she’d berate them for next. For once, he found himself not wishing for her to harm him, but instead praying that she wouldn’t. Their hands shook embarrassingly as they extended them out in front of them, creating a flimsy barrier between the two of them. 
“Pl-Please— I’m s-sorry—”
She continued regardless, and Jaxon’s throat closed up, filled with nothing but anxiety and dread. 
“I’m sorry for not— for not being as st-strong as you. I’m sorry. Please— I’m sorry—”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1320884721462546432 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1320884721462546432><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, 23 December 2024 22:44">22:44</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Jaxon was starting to lose her. Where was she going with this, now?
“I didn’t…kill her. I liked her. I gave— I gave her my necklace. I trusted her to— to get rid of it for me. I don’t— I’m sorry, I don’t get— get what you’re telling me— I’m sorry—”
Even if he sounded nervous before, it was nothing compared to his voice now. They tripped over their words, desperately trying to form sentences. Why was he so short of breath?
“…N-Nobody would be upset with you for— for being upset about h-her. Everyone here’s l-lost people. I don’t think any— anyone’s denying that you two were— were in, uh…<em>love</em>.”
Something resembling envy entered their tone towards the end. It wasn’t fun to see people get further than he’d been able to, even if it ended so suddenly.
Though perhaps it was a blessing in disguise. If anything more had happened with the person they’d loved, it would have ended in him leaving, realising how beyond repair Jaxon truly was. 

The accessory drew his attention immediately, absentmindedly picking out the bits of hair from it and flicking them to the ground. They didn’t make any move to return it, having a feeling that’s not what Caramel would want. It just sat there, in his palm, waiting for something to happen. 
“I don’t…understand. I can’t. I’m not— I’m not in any state to try. I’ve been <em>trying</em> this whole time, Caramel.”
They squeezed their hand around the ribbon.
“Being friends with Yuri, and Lucien, and Apollo…that was me trying. Trying doesn’t…make anything better. I tried, and it ended in people dying. I tried. So, so hard. It’s why I gave Lucien all my love, all my worth. That was trying. Trying to be more trusting, and honest.”
Jaxon went silent for a few moments, before his eyes welled up again, spilling over. 
“And he broke my trust. If this is what trying gets me, I don’t want to try anymore. I just want to stop. I want everything to stop. I want to give up, and stop trying. No matter how much you y-yell at me, I can’t try anymore. It’s all gone.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1320884814118912112 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1320884814118912112><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, 23 December 2024 22:44">22:44</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Jaxon watched her, tears still rolling down his face pathetically. They knew they looked weak. Stupid, even. If Caramel wanted a response, this was what she was getting. He was tired of keeping up appearances — where had that ever gotten him?
They flinched backwards when something was thrust into their face, but they just looked…confused. 
Sure, he’d liked Hattori. But they weren’t friends. 
…Were they?

“I-I’m…confused…”
Hattori looked so full of life, so present, so <em>happy</em>. Was this supposed to make him feel guilty? Feel bad for being so down, when others had died and couldn’t feel that happiness anymore?
“Wouldn’t she want <em>you</em> to feel better? We didn’t speak much. She didn’t like me as much as she liked you. She just…felt bad for me, most of the time.”
Jaxon wiped away their tears, just sort of…unsure. 
“I’m sorry. I’ve tried. I’ve tried to be better. But whenever I do, everything gets worse. I’m sorry if I’m disappointing her by not keeping going, but I…just can’t.”
That softness was slowly coming back to his voice, no more of the anxiety or the bitterness he’d been speaking with. It felt like they were attempting to gently deliver bad news. 

If her goal was to make him feel guilty, it was working. Seeing Caramel so subdued, and so physically exhausted, filled him with guilt. Not quite empathy, but they felt bad for her. 
<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Empathy roll: 35</code>
After a few moments, he cautiously stepped forward and placed a hand on her shoulder. Jaxon was notoriously terrible at reassuring people, so this was likely the best that Caramel would get. 
“…Do you, uh…need anything? I can hug you. If you want that.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>The words that came out of his mouth were those of avoidance, agreeing with every single opinion of hers to wriggle free of the situation. Such easy agreement, turning on all of his opinions from before, it all indicated deception. For as insightful as she could be at times like this, Caramel still didn’t realize just how distressed he was, imagining him rolling his eyes and weaving between her words in dismissal. Like fights within every family, sometimes one individual tried to skip out of the stressful bits by shrugging their shoulders and casually giving up. She continually tried to counter every word, verbally sparring in a way that counterbalancing their physically violent first encounter.

She brought up her shaky hands to stare at how blood-soaked they were, envisioning a mountain of gore covering her, a representation of her making her third critical mistake. Regret greeted her once again like a familiar friend. She was revitalized with adrenaline, activating her fight-or-flight instinct but it was impossible to run from herself.

Knowing that her time in her career was over regardless of the outcome of this game, she only had one thing left to do. To bring the body of Hattori home, and bury her at the conservatory garden; the place of Caramel’s origin.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite making that effort, over and over again, nothing lasted. Even before here, nothing lasted. No matter what they did, Jaxon always ended up the same; alone, and bitter. Maybe that kid in him still yearned for connection, and maybe someone could have gotten through to that. Yuri had, they thought. Lucien had tried his hardest. 
But what did that matter anymore? Both of them were dead, buried in that stupid graveyard. That graveyard he hadn’t visited once since Apollo’s death. One person to mourn was bad enough. Five was overwhelming. Honestly, it was a wonder that Jax wasn’t sobbing on the ground at every given moment. 
Finding out that he had nobody left outside the game was…difficult. There was no real reason for them to be dead, but Akira hadn’t managed to find anyone. Not his friend. Not his friend’s sister. Not his ex. 
Nobody was left, were they?

“…”
Jax wanted to interrupt her, but the words died in their throat. The words she told him were probably true, and some part of him deep, deep down knew that. 
But they didn’t want to admit it. Whether she’d still love him or not didn’t matter, not now. She was dead. That was the hard, undeniable truth. Jaxon wasn’t going to fool themself into thinking anything else. 
PYTHIA’s mention sent a stab of regret into their heart. He’d torn away Riley’s lover, people’s friend, all because she’d had no choice but to kill someone. It was crueller than they knew they could be. He hadn’t even thought twice when Riley’s name had turned up on his screen. All they could think about was Yuri, hair whipping around in the wind as she fell, the blood coughed up after she’d fallen. 
Maybe he could follow her. Fall down from there, let everything end. It’d be poetic, if Jaxon had the mind to appreciate such things. 
The only two ways he was going to die at this point? The two ways their mothers had died.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1324249653583155230 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1324249653583155230><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, 02 January 2025 05:35">05:35</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“…She shouldn’t. If I were her, if I had me for a son. I’d be glad I was dead.”
His words were soft, full of emotion and regret. 
“I wish I hadn’t killed PYTHIA. I wish someone else had gotten to her first. I think everyone else would be better off. They wouldn’t…hate me as much. Maybe Yuri would be proud of me for taking the high road.”
Jaxon tore a thread from their hoodie’s string with their teeth. It was a terrible habit, chewing his clothes. No wonder everything looked in a terrible state nowadays — their clothes were riddled with chewed-away holes. There was so much anxiety in his system, constantly coursing through his veins and sitting at the back of his mind. Even when they slept, they’d wake up with scratched hands, thread in their mouth, and bleeding nails. 
He didn’t blame her for feeling apprehension towards him. They weren’t an enjoyable person to be around, not by a long shot. Especially not anymore. All there was now was a shell, someone who wanted nothing more than to just lay down and perish. 
There was nothing left for him here. Even if Caramel believed Yuri’s child to be their responsibility, it wasn’t. That child would have a far better life with anyone but him, he knew that. Taking care of a cat was much different to raising a child. 

“Caramel. I’m not getting out of here. Isn’t that getting through? I. Am not. Surviving.”
He spoke slowly and purposefully, like it was a fundamental fact of life. 
“Doddy can look after them. I trust them to be a better parental figure than me. Far better. They can look after themself, at least. I can’t do anything of the sort. If I even— If I <em>ever</em> get out of here, I’m fucking killing myself. I can’t live knowing how many people have died here. I can’t. It’s <em>not</em> fair. I can’t live knowing that everyone else here is more deserving of being free. Living on.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1324249744725250058 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1324249744725250058><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, 02 January 2025 05:35">05:35</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Jaxon didn’t move, assuming the closeness was for Caramel’s own benefit. Who was he to refuse her? They were nothing at all. Nothing. He was just a waste of energy, and that energy of hers shouldn’t be wasted on fighting him. They were stuck in their ways, and now? That wouldn’t change. 
He was too scared now. They’d been too scared for a long, long time. 

Really, Jaxon blamed himself for trusting Lucien in the first place. He had been so close with the man that had taken away the person they loved so much — and Jaxon still endeavoured to trust him, to love him regardless. 
But he was no better than Kinto, in Jax’s eyes. He was cruel, and selfish, and stupid. Maybe Jax still loved him, and still felt so attached to him. That betrayal had soured it all, though. And knowing he’d planned for it made everything obsolete.

“It does. That’s exactly what it means. He knew he was going to die. He lied. I told him everything, and he <em>still</em> lied to me. I don’t care if you think it’s wrong for me to ignore everything he did before; what’s that going to do? I’d rather be angry than sad. It’s easier.”
Jaxon’s body tensed up, inching a half-step away from Caramel so that they weren’t touching anymore. 
“No. Don’t touch me. Don’t help me, don’t try to fix me. I don’t want you to fix me. I don’t want to be fixed.”
He folded his arms, staring Caramel directly in the eyes. 
“Khuong was nothing. And I <em>knew</em> what Felix was doing. He told me. I helped him <em>because</em> he told me. And you know what? I would’ve helped Lucien get out if he’d told me too. But he didn’t. He told me he wasn’t gonna do anything, he told me he was going to live. They’re not the same at all. I don’t care about him, his dreams. He’s meaningless. And if that means I’m playing into Akira’s hands, then fine. He’ll kill me eventually anyway.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1324249795732439120 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1324249795732439120><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, 02 January 2025 05:35">05:35</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Jaxon squeezed his eyes shut, fighting every instinct in him telling him to run away, or fight back. Nothing would fix it. Nothing would make her stop yelling. 
“I’m not hiding. I know what I’ve done. I’ve been beating myself up about it every moment I’ve been alone. I <em>know</em> it’s my fault. I’m not saying it isn’t. Everything’s my fault. I stabbed you first. I nearly got another innocent killed lying for my friend. I closed myself off. I lashed out after losing everyone. I turned my friend away when he begged for my forgiveness. I’ve done nothing but sit and mope and drink and cry for weeks now. I know that’s all me. I know that’s my fault. I’m not stupid, Caramel. I know it’s my decision. I don’t want to fix it. I want to stay this miserable so someone takes pity on me and kills me already.”

Jaxon didn’t deny a word she said. He knew he was terrible. He knew he was mean, cruel, selfish, every word under the sun. Whatever abuse she’d throw at them, they’d take it without question. 
“They won’t haunt you. You don’t have to try. It’s— It’s alright.”
Still sniffling, still staring at her. Of all the people Jaxon expected to be afraid of, Caramel was far from the list. 
“I’m not capable. I’ve been trying this whole time — it’s always left me worse off. It’s better for everyone. Better for you. Don’t waste yourself worrying about me. Please.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1324249879945547816 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1324249879945547816><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, 02 January 2025 05:36">05:36</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Jaxon was doing his best to avoid her rage, making himself smaller as he backed away and did everything he’d learned to do to avoid someone like this. They’d had plenty of practice, unfortunately for them. Every inch of him resembled a scared animal, cornered and shaking. Too weak to fight back, too afraid to leave and risk initiating a chase. 
The sound of her voice rippled in their ears like acid, wearing them down and reducing them to tears. Perhaps it wasn’t entirely her fault that he reacted in such a way, but that didn’t stop the fact that he was so afraid of her. 
Standing, waiting for her to lash out and hit them…it was agonising. He wished she’d just get it over with already. Stop leaving them in the horrible, painful suspense and just hurt them already. He knew he’d done wrong. He’d admitted it, he’d apologised. 
But they just stared at her as she changed demeanour, almost as afraid as they felt. He looked at her, confused. This was…new. What happened? Where was the shouting, the yelling? The hitting? Where was any of it?

“Wh-What? No. No. Stop it. No, I’m <em>telling</em> you to hurt me. Don’t— What’s— What’s happening? Huh?”
Tears still on his face, forgotten, Jaxon slowly approached Caramel. If it was a trap, if she was going to hurt them when they got close, that was okay. She deserved it. 
“Stop it. S-Stop—”
He looked down at her, unsure what to do. They didn’t want to touch her, but she looked pretty pathetic falling onto her ass. He reached out a hand regardless, offering to help her up. Whatever she decided, they didn’t mind. They just wanted her to stop. Her blabbering and tripping over her words just made him pity her, which was strange considering just moments ago she’d been digging into him, tearing him apart with just her words. 

“…Sorry. I’m not ignoring you, it’s fine. I’m sorry. I’m selfish. I’m jealous. I’m a dick. I know. Maybe I haven’t directly killed anyone, but I’m still…just as bad. Maybe worse, ‘cause I’m not dead yet.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1324249955128442932 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1324249955128442932><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, 02 January 2025 05:36">05:36</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>They stepped backward, gaze still locked on Caramel in case she made a single sudden movement. He was ready to run, if it was needed. Jaxon’s breathing eventually steadied, since she’d calmed down somewhat. They didn’t trust it much, but it was better than being yelled at still. Truth be told, he didn’t trust her much at all, least of all now with how quickly she’d switched up. 
There was little to be said about Hattori, at least for Jax. He could offer his condolences for her death, or say she’d been a good person, but it was less than enough for Caramel, wasn’t it? She needed comfort, needed someone to rely on. 
Someone like that…wasn’t here right now. 

“…You weren’t, though. She talked to me about you, after Lucien’s trial. Asked me how to differentiate platonic and romantic feelings. She sounded head-over-heels for you. You were lucky to have her.”
They simply shrugged. 
“It’s okay to be upset, or mad. I’ve not been nice to you. I’ve just…whatever. I don’t wanna keep saying it.”

Jaxon’s heart had been aching for months now after losing Apollo. Even after he found out it wasn’t because of that pathetic little argument they’d had, he still couldn’t accept it. 
It was the first time they’d been held so affectionately, spoken to so gently, in a long time. It was only natural to miss it.
Even so, that ache refused to dull. And thinking about him only made it worse. Was it fair at all that Caramel had so much more time? So many more opportunities to shower her lover with affection, even the opportunity to be open and honest about her feelings?
It wasn’t. Not in Jaxon’s head. Maybe they weren’t a good person, but didn’t they at least deserve something? One small, tiny thing?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1324250028239487077 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1324250028239487077><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, 02 January 2025 05:36">05:36</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Jaxon listened to her, now finally breaking his gaze and staring down at the ground. Her words were gentler now, less piercing and more…warm. Comforting. She understood him, finally. 
But instead of it being a pleasant feeling, it twisted into something sickening. Suffocating. Maybe she understood how they felt, but it wasn’t something Jaxon wanted. Too little, too late. 
“Just— That’s enough. Stop it.”
He stopped for a moment when she took her words back. 
Nothing about this conversation felt understandable anymore. It was so confusing, all of it. First she hated his guts, then she berated him, then she apologised profusely, and now she took it all back?
What a strange exchange it was. 
“…I— Uh—”
Jax blinked, not sure what to say. 
“…Thanks.”

They looked pretty uncomfortable being apologised to again, even if it was less of a begging for forgiveness and more of a genuine apology. Shifting from foot to foot, Jax avoided Caramel’s gaze like a plague. 
“No, it’s really fine. Don’t apologise. It’s fine. Stop.”
He put out a hand in front of him, putting more distance between the pair of them. This interaction was getting more uncomfortable for him by the minute, and he was desperate to find an opening to leave. 

The smile in question had quite the opposite effect, leaving Jaxon more worried she was about to do something stupid than anything else. Kill him, hurt herself…they had no idea. Really? They didn’t want to know.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1324250095939620917 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1324250095939620917><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, 02 January 2025 05:37">05:37</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>JR: Jaxon put a hand on his arm, still not looking as he let her speak. They felt bad for her, that much was quite obvious. It was clear on his face, that pity that he’d grown to hate so much when directed towards himself. But towards others? It was all they felt to her right now. 
“It’s fine. I’m sure she’s still proud of— of…you.”
The words died in his throat, feeling all too familiar to what she’d already told him. Yuri would still love them even now, and Caramel’s sister would still love her even now. Perhaps more so. She’d found love, she’d made friends. Anyone would be proud of her. <em>He</em> would be, if they were closer. 
“You’re a good person. I just…bring out the worst in people.”

Jaxon just sighed.
“You had an impact on people. Everyone here. Just…maybe not me. You made people feel better. You made people happy. I’d be proud of you for it.”
They shrugged.
“…You know I can’t.”

With Caramel seemingly finished speaking, Jax began backing away again. He didn’t want to continue this conversation. It wasn’t right.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
